Further studies on different foods led to the discovery of an \"anti-haemorraghic factor\", which was designated vitamin K (with the \"K\" standing for \"Koagulations-Vitamin\") given that it was essential for normal haemostasis.\u003cbr\u003eVitamin K1 is acquired through the diet and is prevalently present in leafy green vegetables such as spinach, Swiss chard, Brassica (e.g. cabbage, kale, cauliflower, turnip, and Brussels sprout), some fruits such as avocado, banana and kiwi, as well as in some vegetable oils, especially soybean oil. Many bacteria that colonize the human intestine synthesize vitamin K2 or menaquinone, There is, however, ongoing debate on whether bacterial synthesis of vitamin K in the intestine provides a significant supply of this vitamin in humans. \u003cbr\u003eAccording to the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin K is 120 μg in adult men and 90 μg in adult women, but it is much lower in other countries and Europe, where, for example, a daily average of ~1 μg per kg of body weight is recommended. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey set the thresholds of adequate vitamin K intake as 2 μg/day for infants in the first 6 months of life. Human breast milk contains between 1 and 4 μg/L of vitamin K1.\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the age of onset, there are three types of the desease that had been named \"Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB)\" in 1999.\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003ci\u003eEarly\u003c/i\u003e VKDB presents within 24 hours of birth and is almost exclusively seen in infants of mothers taking drugs which inhibit vitamin K. These drugs include anticonvulsants, antituberculosis drugs, some antibiotics and vitamin K antagonists (coumarin, warfarin). The clinical presentation is often severe with cephalic haematoma and intracranial and intra-abdominal haemorrhages. The incidence of early VKDB in neonates of mothers taking these drugs without vitamin K supplementation varies from 6% to 12%.\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003ci\u003eClassical\u003c/i\u003e VKDB occurs between 24 hours and 7 days of life and is associated with delayed or insufficient feeding. The clinical presentation is often mild, with bruises, gastrointestinal blood loss or bleeding from the umbilicus and puncture sites. Blood loss can, however, be significant, and intracranial haemorrhage, although rare, has been described. Estimates of the frequency vary from 0.25% to 1.5% in older reviews and 0–0.44% in more recent reviews.\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003ci\u003eLate\u003c/i\u003e VKDB is associated with exclusive breast-feeding. It occurs between the ages of 2 and 12 weeks. The clinical presentation is severe, with a mortality rate of 20% and intracranial haemorrhage occurring in 50%. Persistent neurological damage is frequent in survivors. In fully breast-fed infants who did not receive vitamin K at birth, the incidence is between 1/15,000 and 1/20,000. Babies with cholestasis or malabsorption syndromes are at particular risk.\u003cbr\u003eAs in other circumstances in science and medicine, there is an apparent paradox in haemostasis in neonates in that prolonged global coagulation tests do not translate into a particular bleeding phenotype. In fact, it is now clear that the physiology of haemostasis in childhood differs considerably from that in adults. Studies in humans and animals clearly indicate that coagulation factors in neonates are qualitatively similar to those in adults.

Despite such a lengthy track record, BCG vaccination has also generated at least as much controversy as any other form of immunisation. Most importantly, the capacity to protect individuals against tuberculosis is still debated, since randomised clinical trials have provided estimates ranging from 80% protection to no benefit. Traditionally, BCG vaccines have been considered among the safest in use. However, the true incidence of disease due to BCG strains (called “BCG-itis” or “BCG-osis”) is unknown.\u003cbr\u003eWith the concerns about BCG efficacy and safety have come calls for new vaccines against tuberculosis. Various new vaccine candidates have been developed and tested in animal models. Notably, of nearly 200 candidate vaccines tested to date, only one has provided better protection than BCG, a recombinant form of BCG itself.\u003cbr\u003eThe history of BCG begins with pathogenesis experiments by Calmette and Guerin in the first decade of the 20th century. To study tuberculosis in cattle, they worked with cultures of bovine tubercle bacilli (M. bovis), which explains why our present vaccines against M. tuberculosis are derived from closely related M. bovis. The importance of differences between M tuberculosis and M bovis in the derivation of a live, attenuated vaccine against human tuberculosis remains unknown.\u003cbr\u003eFor optimum oral infection of cattle and guineapigs, Calmette added a detergent, specifically bile, to the culture medium, to prevent the bacteria from clumping. Within a few months, an unusual colony type arose, which was less virulent to the guinea pigs. Calmette continued the process of growing these bacteria in the presence of bile, for 13 years, changing the nutrient medium every two weeks.\u003cbr\u003eBeginning in 1921, BCG was administered to people to prevent tuberculosis. At this time, it was not possible to freeze-dry (lyophilise) BCG or put away a stock of the strain in a freezer. Therefore, BCG continued to be grown in much the same conditions that had resulted in its original attenuation until the lyophilisation of BCG-Pasteur after 1173 passages in 1961.\u003cbr\u003eDuring these decades, the same poorly understood laboratory selective pressures that had created BCG in the first place were presumably still at work. Since Calmette first reported attenuation of virulence after 15 passages in vitro and reported further attenuation of virulence over the next 215 passages, was it possible that no further attenuation would happen during the subsequent 943 passages? Since neither the parent strain of M. bovis that gave rise to BCG nor the original BCG of 1921 are available for study, this question cannot be answered directly.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1924, BCG lots began to be distributed to various different countries for local preparation of vaccine. BCG was propagated at these laboratories in the same conditions as at the Pasteur Institute, with the same goals – namely to prevent BCG from reverting to virulence while preserving an acceptable degree of what was called “potency”. Over the course of a few decades, each of these BCG vaccine laboratories developed its own daughter strain of BCG, typically named after the laboratory director, the city, or the country.\u003cbr\u003ePresently, all BCG strains are prepared as lyophilised stocks that are resuspended before inoculation. The proportion of BCG vaccine that is dead versus live varies greatly after reconstitution. Most lyophilised BCG vaccines are 90–95% dead bacteria, but BCG-Tokyo is a notable exception, estimated to consist of perhaps 25% live bacteria at vaccination. The importance of the proportion of viable bacteria in the vaccine has yet to be formally assessed; for instance, does giving more dead bacteria compensate?\u003cbr\u003eIn the rational design of an attenuated vaccine, one would presumably attempt to remove virulence factors while maintaining antigens. It is known today that several antigenic proteins are either absent from all BCG strains or absent / not expressed in BCG vaccines obtained after 1931. The loss of antigens from certain BCG strains is apparently contrary to what would be desired and suggests an important phenotype for further study.\u003cbr\u003eThe other important phenotype of BCG strains is their safety, and more specifically the rate of BCG dissemination. One such experiment involved the replacement of BCG-Prague with BCG-Russia in the former country of Czechoslovakia. Rates of disseminated BCG disease, including BCG osteitis were greater with the Russian strain. An epidemic of BCG osteitis was also reported in Sweden and Finland in the 1970s, but not due to a change of strain, rather because the Swedish strain of BCG was sent to Copenhagen for production of vaccine. In Sweden, BCG vaccination was halted. In Finland, BCG vaccination continued, with a change to another BCG strain.\u003cbr\u003eHave BCG strains evolved over time? The answer is clearly yes. Does this matter? The answer depends on who is asked. A bacteriologist would be surprised if BCG has not changed considerably during a half-century of growth in the laboratory. For the person planning to administer BCG to an infant or the public-health official planning for the vaccination of millions of newborns, more information is needed. Is there a “most protective BCG”? Is there a “safest BCG”? Are these necessarily different? Unfortunately, answers to these questions cannot yet be given.\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether the future involves specific BCG strains, a genetically altered BCG, or a completely new vaccine, one hopes that those currently providing BCG vaccines will be prepared to validate laboratory observations in the field, so that we are not again left with the uncertainty of vaccinating millions each year without a clear understanding of its risks and benefits.","title":"BCG - different strains, different vaccines?","info_place":"Lancet Infect Dis","info_date":"2002","infoID":"11901655"},{"info_authors":"Lawn","info_place":"Lancet","num":2.0,"link":"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)62173-3/abstract","digest":"The BCG vaccine has been given to 4 billion people since 1921, and to more than 90% of the children in the world today, however, it has done little to contain the current tuberculosis pandemic.

All of these measures were used at sanatoria  and helped to cause and maintain a decline in mortality due to TB throughout the 19th century. Antibiotics and other chemical therapies were introduced in the 1940s and 1950s. However, their use caused the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Some strains have even been observed to be extensively drug resistant and are very difficult and expensive to treat (estimated cost US$500,000–1,000,000 per patient for hospital-based care in high-income countries). In Peru, the incidence of TB has declined 3.7% per year since 1996, but the incidence of cases with drug resistant strains has increased by 4.5%.

In Brazil and Japan antibiotics were effective in combination with conservative measures and public health interventions.\u003cbr\u003eIn Sierra Leone, the TB mortality rate had increased 3-fold in 20 years, despite availability of antibiotics, which are ineffective. The mortality rate in Japan had rapidly increased in the end of 19th to beginning of 20th centuries. This increase in mortality rate in Japan (and most probably in other countries before statistical data was being acquired) occurred during the initial heavy industrialization.","title":"Lessons from history of socioeconomic improvements: a new approach to treating multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.","info_place":"J Biosoc Sci","info_authors":"Holloway","info_date":"2014","infoID":"24103436"},{"info_authors":"Fox","info_place":"PLoS Pathog","num":5.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4721647/","digest":"In an accident later known as the Lübeck disaster, 251 neonates were orally given three doses of the new Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) antituberculosis (TB) vaccine contaminated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

First, while mortality was high (approximately 29%), the majority of neonates inoculated with M. tuberculosis eventually overcame TB disease. This shows the high constitutional resistance of humans to the bacillus. Second, while at low levels of M. tuberculosis there was a large spread of clinical phenotypes reflecting a good degree of innate resistance to TB, at the highest dose, the majority of neonates were highly susceptible to TB. This shows the dominating role of dose for innate resistance to TB. Third, two infants inoculated with the lowest dose nevertheless died of TB, and their median time from inoculation to death was substantially shorter than for those who died after inoculation with higher doses. This suggests that infants who developed disease after low dose inoculation are those who are most susceptible to the disease.","title":"Tuberculosis in Newborns: The Lessons of the \"Lübeck Disaster\".","info_geo":["Germany"],"info_type":"article","info_date":"2016","infoID":"PMC4721647"},{"info_place":"PLoS One","title":"The Association between Active and Passive Smoking and Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children in the United States: Results from NHANES.","infoID":"PMC3963991","info_date":"2014","header":"Risk Factors","info_type":"article","num":6.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963991/","I_S_codenames":["smoking"],"info_geo":["US"],"info_authors":"Lindsay","digest":"Active and passive smoking is associated with a doubling of the risk of tuberculosis.

The trial results published in 2013 showed no evidence of added protection.\u003cbr\u003eBefore the 2009 efficacy trial in South African babies, it had been tested in mice, guinea pigs, cattle, and monkeys and had also undergone early phase safety and immunogenicity trials in humans. However, in 2015 an independent systematic review of eight studies using 192 animals published between 2003 and 2010 concluded that the data did not provide evidence to support efficacy of MVA85A as a BCG booster. Two studies showed significant protection, but in these MVA85A was given differently from the way it was given in humans. One was in guinea pigs and MVA85A was further boosted with a recombinant fowlpox virus. The other was a mouse experiment when both BCG and MVA85A were given intranasally rather than intradermally.\u003cbr\u003eIn a UK study in rhesus macaque monkeys, four of the six macaques given BCG alone survived to the end of the experiment. Worryingly, however, only one of the six macaques that received BCG plus MVA85A survived. This study raised the possibility that MVA85A was unsafe and actually impairing the effectiveness of BCG. All this was known to researchers for a year and a half before the start of tests on infants. Nevertheless, the researchers had suppressed this information when they presented the results at the TB conference in Vancouver in 2007, in funding applications and in applications for conducting human trials. They also failed to communicate it to the parents whose babies participated in the vaccine testing.\u003cbr\u003ePeter Beverley, at that time a principal research fellow at Oxford University, was warried about the absence of the data and repeatedly expressed his concerns about the macaque study. In response, the Oxford University shut down Beverley's laboratory. It also refused to provide the trial protocols to the BMJ.\u003cbr\u003e(Mind you, all this happened in Oxford – the most prestigious university in the world. One can only guess what are the practices in other universities and in the pharmaceutical companies' labs).","title":"Oxford TB vaccine study calls into question selective use of animal data.","info_place":"BMJ","info_geo":["UK","SouthAfrica"],"info_authors":"Cohen","info_date":"2018","infoID":"10.1136/ bmj.j5845"},{"info_type":"article","info_place":"Med Hypotheses","num":35.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10499822/","info_date":"1999","title":"Tuberculosis II: the failure of the BCG vaccine.","info_authors":"Maes","digest":"The rapid progress of the tuberculous endemy in the 1860s corresponds to the period of industrialization, urbanization and pauperism existing in Europe at that time. Initially, the two professions principally at risk were the lacemakers and the laundresses.\u003cbr\u003eKoch described the bacillus in 1882 and the tuberculin was presented as the first immunotherapeutic product against TB in 1890. The vaccinal treatment with tuberculin ended with the death of 55 of the first 1769 patients treated.\u003cbr\u003eA second candidate for TB vaccine was M. chelonae, live bacillus of Friedmann, which natural pathogenicity for mammals was weak. However the raise of antisemitism and of nationalism resulted in a lawsuit against Friedmann in 1937, the suppression of manufacture of the product in Italy at the demand of Hitler, the burning of the Friedman Institute in Leipzig and a French legal interdiction to use this vaccine, in favor of live attenuated M. bovis.\u003cbr\u003eChildren having developed a tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis after drinking milk contaminated with M. bovis appeared protected against more serious forms of pulmonary TB and thus became the third candidate for the TB vaccine. Calmette proceeded to attenuate the bovine bacillus by repeated subculture in vitro for 13 years. This live vaccine provoked a general lymphatic disease in the guinea-pig that was claimed to heal spontaneously within 3 weeks. On the basis of this observation, the vaccine was administered per os to human newborns, despite the fact that the BCG itself was shown to multiply during months in various organs of the guinea pig.\u003cbr\u003eCalmette refused to evaluate the consequences of this last observation. To monkeys at risk, the vaccine lent no protection at all, but Calmette refused to examine either the monkeys or the results. In children, the protective efficacy of the vaccine was wildly exaggerated: the occasional occurrence of meningitis cases in vaccinees was explained by contaminations with M. tuberculosis, which indeed occurred once and served as an explanation for all the cases.\u003cbr\u003eThe flaws in the experimental designs set up to prove the efficacy of the BCG, and the misuse of the statistics exploiting the results came to full light when Sweden discontinued the universal coverage of its population and analysed the effects of this measure: the adverse effects were tenfold superior to those commonly reported.\u003cbr\u003eThe chairman of UNICEF’s Subcommittee on Medical Projects was the brother of an influencial French politician who needed reconstruction money, pacific heroes and heroic achievements for a country that had emerged in discomfiture from World War II. The Pasteur Institute, BCG and Calmette fulfilled his expectations, and UNICEF offered $3 million to the WHO to endorse the vaccine. The WHO accepted the bribe and popularized the vaccine.\u003cbr\u003eThe undisputable epidemiological evidence of vaccine inefficacy shown by a regression of the endemy in non-covered countries at a rate similar to that observed in vaccinated populations was met with procrastination. No heed was given to the disastrous South-India trial (see paragraph 10 above). The claim that the BCG was totally innocuous paralysed the faculty of analysis concerning the BCGitis cases observed after vaccination.","infoID":"10499822"},{"info_place":"Arch Dis Child","title":"Unreliability of the Mantoux test using 1 TU PPD in excluding childhood tuberculosis in Papua New Guinea.","infoID":"PMC1626920","info_date":"1980","header":"Mantoux test","info_type":"article","num":36.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1626920/","info_geo":["PapuaNewGuinea"],"info_authors":"Murtagh","digest":"139 children in Papua New Guinea with bacteriological or histological proof of active tuberculosis were given the Mantoux tuberculin test.

In the RotaTeq vaccine strains, some human rotavirus segments are replaced with bovine rotavirus.

Only 10 particles are sufficient to get infected. This is why adults, who change babies’ diapers, are at risk of getting infected.

Fortunately, we have vaccines and antiviral drugs. \u003cbr\u003eVaricella resembles poliomyelitis, in a sense that a serious disease is partially a consequence of the progress in developed countries. The nature of the disease changed radically after Sydney Farber invented chemotherapy. The joy of the success was tainted when a boy, who survived chemotherapy, was killed by varicella, which can be deadly under conditions of immunodeficiency. When drugs that weaken immunity became widely used, varicella could no longer be considered a harmless rite of childhood. It became a disease that was feared and avoided. The first steps towards solving this iatrogenic problem were taken by Thomas Weller, who isolated the virus. This feat was a prerequisite for developing a vaccine. \u003cbr\u003eAs chemotherapy, steroids and antimetabolites, which are used to treat autoimmune diseases or to suppress immunity for organ transplantation, became more common, and the life expectancy increased, not only varicella, but also the shingles, turned into a significant clinical problem.

Advancing the health of one population group damages the health of another group. \u003cbr\u003eAlthough mass varicella vaccination program was launched in a few countries, while other countries wait for the final research results of the exogenous boosting effect, there has not been an attempt for an ethical analysis of vaccination. \u003cbr\u003eThe issue of vaccination cannot be solved by simple ethical rules, such as “respect for autonomy” (vaccinate) or “do no harm to others” (do not vaccinate). It requires a balance between competing interests of different groups, and thus, requires a more complex ethical approach. \u003cbr\u003eThe authors address this ethical issue through two fundamental ethical approaches: classic utilitarianism and contractualism. \u003cbr\u003eThe utilitarianism approach is based on two premises: (1) effect of the choice on the wellbeing (happiness and health) is the only aspect that really matters, and (2) the wellbeing of everyone is equally important. That is, increase in the average level of wellbeing is what’s important when choosing alternatives. \u003cbr\u003eTherefore, in case of the chickenpox, the question is whether vaccination will cause an overall decrease in varicella incidence. Despite the fact that empirical data from USA indicates an 88% decrease in chickenpox hospitalization rates and 74% decrease in chickenpox mortality rates, this data does not take into account the effect on the elderly. If it is taken into account, vaccination becomes less attractive, since it is estimated that the increase in the shingles incidence will exceed the decrease in the chickenpox incidence. \u003cbr\u003eTherefore, according to classic utilitarianism, mass vaccination is undesirable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the contractualism point of view, an ethical decision is not determined by the consequences, but rather by the justification in terms of principles and rules arising from the hypothetical ‘social contract.’ This contract is concluded between all people, and it defines the fundamental rules that should govern society. \u003cbr\u003eThat is, unlike the utilitarianism approach, what’s important is not the quantitative benefit of the vaccination, but whether its introduction can be justified by the generally accepted principles. These principles should also be acceptable to those who stand to be disadvantaged by them – adults and elderly. \u003cbr\u003eThe following considerations are examined: \u003cbr\u003e1) Freedom to protect one’s health (through vaccination).\u003cbr\u003e2) Responsibility. Elderly can vaccinate against shingles. This vaccine is considered to be safe. \u003cbr\u003e3) Unacceptable sacrifice. Some elderly would not be able to get protection against shingles (since the vaccine is not effective enough or contraindicated). These people would be sacrificed for the benefit of a large group of children. However, since the herpes zoster is rarely lethal, this sacrifice is acceptable. \u003cbr\u003e4) Uncertainly. Although exogenous boosting exists, its effect on the incidence of herpes zoster is less known than the effect of vaccination on varicella incidence. Therefore, it is possible to demand giving more importance to something already determined, that something that is not fully known yet. \u003cbr\u003eThus, from the contractualism point of view, mass vaccination is fully justified, since it is not clear why children should protect the elderly. Contractualism emphasizes impartial a priori rules, and not the a posteriori consequences, and therefore, depends less on the quantitative evaluations of these consequences. \u003cbr\u003eThe authors conclude that the decision to introduce vaccination should be based not only on quantitative data and research, but also on the ethical premises.","title":"Varicella-zoster virus vaccination under the exogenous boosting hypothesis: two ethical perspectives.","info_type":"article","info_date":"2014","infoID":"25454883"},{"header":"Benefits of varicella","num":30.0,"digest":"Several studies were cited in the measles section.

This is due to the fact that B2 cells do not synthesize antibodies without the signal of T-helper cells. In order for this to happen, the B2-cell, and its related T-helper cell, should recognize the same, or similar [epitope==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope]. But since T cells recognize only protein epitopes, T helper cells are usually able to activate B2 cells in response to protein antigens. In response to bacterial capsular polysaccharides, the immune system forms a response through cells B1 and MZB (Marginal zone B). B1 cells do not begin to react to bacterial carbohydrate antigens until 18-24 months, and their response does not fully mature until about 5 years of age. Therefore, infants and young children are unable to respond effectively to capsular bacteria. Conjugated vaccines use the fact that B2 cells and their related T helper cells do not have to respond to an identical epitope, but rather recognize closely related epitopes. Although the mechanisms by which conjugate vaccines work are not fully understood, it is believed that [antigen-presenting cells==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell], treat the combined protein carrier and carbohydrate [hapten==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapten], which leads to recognition of the protein carrier by T-helper cells, and recognition of carbohydrate antigens by B2 cells. That is, conjugated vaccines change the immunological response to carbohydrate antigens in infants and young children, from a hypo-sensitive to a full T cell response.\u003cbr\u003eBecause antibodies against carbohydrate antigens are often autoreactive with their own carbohydrates, the differentiation of B cells to B2 cells can lead to an autoimmune reaction. Therefore, B cells against carbohydrate antigens are carefully regulated by the immune system. Antibodies to native carbohydrates are associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, myocarditis and rheumatic heart disease, Sydenham's chorea, and children's autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS).\u003cbr\u003eUnlike antibodies produced by B2 cells, antibodies produced by B1 and MZB cells are short-lived and [low-affinity==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)], and conducted to an autoimmune reaction with\u003cbr\u003eAutism has an increased level of antibodies to nervous structures and an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain, which indicates that autoimmune and neuroinflammatory processes can play a role in some cases of autism.\u003cbr\u003eBecause [myelinization==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin] (the formation of an insulating nerve fibers) is most intense during the first 9 months of life, and continues in early childhood, neuronal development in infants and young children can be particularly vulnerable to self-reactive antibodies, including those that react with glycoproteins in myelin sheaths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first conjugate vaccine (from Hib) appeared in the US in 1988, and was later licensed in most other developed countries, including Denmark in 1993, and Izr ail, where it was licensed in 1992, and introduced into the national vaccination calendar in 1994.\u003cbr\u003eThe incidence of autism began to rise dramatically in the US since births in the middle of 1987. In Denmark and Israel, the jump in autism began about 5 years later.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1990, the vaccine was licensed to infants from the age of two months, which may explain the further increase in autism.Another explanation for the increase in autism in the mid-90s could be a change in the protein carrier used in the vaccine, which made her more immune gene. If the Hib vaccine is an autism trigger, then an increase in its immunogenicity and a change in the [binding site==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site] may increase the likelihood of autism.\u003cbr\u003eThe licensing of the pneumococcal vaccine in 2000 may partially explain the further increase in autism. Children born in 1995 were the first to be vaccinated against pneumococcus, and this is consistent with CDC data, according to which the level of autism in 1992-1994 did not change, and in 1998 autism was already 57% higher than in 1994, m.\u003cbr\u003eIn Denmark, the Hib vaccine was licensed in 1993, but immediately followed by an aggressive vaccination campaign for children, starting in 1988, which coincides with the growth of autism among those born in 1988 and later. \u003e In Israel, the number of children receiving disability benefits due to autism did not change from 1972 to 1995. But from 1996 to 1998, their number increased 5-fold, which is explained by this hypothesis. In 2004, 11% of the beneficiaries were born in 1985-89 (before vaccine licensing), 21.1% were born in 1990-94 (the beginning of vaccination), and 37% were born in 1995-99 (immediately after the vaccination was introduced National calendar). The immune system in response to the carbohydrate membrane of capsular bacteria produces antibodies through B1 and MZB cells in adults, and in children older than 5 years. But children under 5 years of age react poorly to carbohydrate antigens. Conjugated vaccines consist of a protein carrier attached to a carbohydrate antigen, and are able to circumvent this restriction of the immune system to carbohydrate antigens in children. Due to the protein carrier, these vaccines can induce the production of antibodies by B2 cells.\u003cbr\u003e The development of antibodies to carbohydrate antigens via B2 cells is a significant departure from the natural paradigm in which B1 and MZB cells usually produce short-lived antibodies against carbohydrate antigens, and B2 cells produce more long-living against protein antigens. In addition to the fact that the immune system of children under 5 years of age reacts poorly to capsular bacteria, the maternal IgM and IgG2 antibodies do not pass well the placenta, from which it follows that the embryos are probably also not protected from capsular bacteria. From the point of view of evolution, this is quite unexpected. It is possible that this evolutionary flaw is accompanied by a compensatory evolutionary advantage. One possible explanation is that antibodies to carbohydrate antigens can be cross-reactive with neuronal glycoproteins, and a fine balance has been achieved, by evolution, between evolutionary protection against capsular bacteria and the need for development of the nervous system. This is consistent with the fact that myelination begins with infancy, and lasts until early childhood, which coincides with the period during which the immune system is hypo-sensitive to carbohydrate antigens. Moreover, the period during which the immune system is least sensitive to carbohydrate antigens corresponds to the period of the most intense myelination. It is possible that antibodies to carbohydrates not only interfere with the development of the nervous system in infants and young children, but their negative effects are strengthened by a stable a response of the immune system induced by conjugated vaccines, which significantly disturbs the balance achieved by evolution.","info_geo":["US","Denmark","Israel"],"is_hidden":1,"I_S_codenames":["autism"]}],"editdate":{"$date":"2020-04-09T08:18:16.777Z"},"translated":1,"interpreter":"","interpreter_link":"","I_S_namespace":"Vaccination"}

Twenty years ago, in 1990, 32 million doses of influenza vaccine were available in the United States. Today around 135 million doses of influenza vaccine annually enter the US market. This enormous growth has not been fueled by popular demand but instead by a public health campaign that delivers a straightforward message: influenza is a serious disease, we are all at risk of complications from influenza, the flu shot is virtually risk free, and vaccination saves lives. Through this lens, the lack of influenza vaccine availability for all 315 million US citizens seems to border on the unethical. Yet across the country, mandatory influenza vaccination policies have cropped up, particularly in healthcare facilities, precisely because not everyone wants the vaccination, and compulsion appears the only way to achieve high vaccination rates. \u003cbr\u003eIn 1960-s CDC recommended vaccination only for elderly people (from 65 years old);\u003cbr\u003e1984 – the introduction of medical personnel vaccination; \u003cbr\u003e1987 – vaccination of those who share household with elderly people;\u003cbr\u003e1997 – vaccination of pregnant women in 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy;\u003cbr\u003e2000 – vaccination of people older than 50 years old; \u003cbr\u003e2004 – vaccination of pregnant women during the 1st trimester of pregnancy, as well as children from 6   months to two years old and all who come in contact with them;\u003cbr\u003e2006 – vaccination of children up to 5 years old and all who come in contact with them;\u003cbr\u003e2008 – vaccination of all children up to 18 years old;\u003cbr\u003e2010 – total vaccination of all population with the exception of babies younger than 6 months old.\u003cbr\u003eBased on a single observation study (financed by CDC) CDC made the statement that flu vaccine reduces mortality by 48%. If this should be true than flu vaccines could save more lives than any medicine registered on our planet. If influenza is responsible for a mere 5% of winter mortality, the flu vaccine cannot prevent half of all life losses.\u003cbr\u003eIf observational studies are not to be believed, what evidence is there that vaccines reduce mortality among elderly people? Practically none. Only one randomized study among elderly people was conducted 20 years ago, and it did not show that flu vaccines help to reduce mortality. In other words, the flu vaccine is being recommended regardless of total absence of clinical studies showing its effectiveness. This recommendations is based solely on the presence of antibodies, however there is no proof that these antibodies lead to reduced morbidity.

Governments that took advice from WHO have spent billions of dollars’ worth of antivirus vaccines oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). One year later — and these vaccines lay stockpiled unused in warehouses around the world, whilst governments were unwinding their vaccine contracts. Scientists who were helping WHO to put together vaccination recommendations were employed by pharmaceutical companies - a conflict of interest which was kept carefully under wraps. This is how the vaccine-producing pharmaceutical companies were using WHO to pass recommendations to governments to stock on vaccine supplies, as they would be in short supply once the flu pandemic sets in. WHO keeps secret the member list of its Committee for Emergency Situations. Dr. Margaret Chan refused to comment on the conflict of interest issue. A few months prior to announcing the pandemic WHO changed the criteria used to determine whether pandemic is indeed taking place, as it was no longer deemed necessary to assess morbidity and mortality.\u003cbr\u003eWHO did not have any scientific foundations to conclude that 2 billion people would be infected with swine flu.

A blood sample is taken from children before and after vaccination. After that, a virus is added to the blood, which creates plaques as it infects the cells. Comparing the amount of these plagues in the blood before and after vaccination indicates the effectiveness of the vaccine. \u003cbr\u003eInstead of testing how children’s blood neutralizes the wild virus strain, Merck was testing how it neutralizes the vaccine strain. However, this was still not enough to demonstrate the required 95% effectiveness. Thus, rabbit antibodies were added to the tested children’s blood, bringing the effectiveness level to 100%.\u003cbr\u003eAnd that is not all of it. Since adding animal antibodies showed pre-vaccine effectiveness of 80% (instead of 10%), the fraud was evident. First, the number of added rabbit antibodies was changed, but it did not give the desired results. So they simply began to falsify the plaque counting, and counted plaques that actually were not in the blood. Falsified data was entered into an Excel file, since changing paper forms took too much time, plus this tactic did not leave any traces of falsification.  \u003cbr\u003eStill, the virologists did contact the FDA and the FDA sent an agent for a check.

Cells, in which the virus is grown, need to multiply. To do so, they need a nutrient medium with hormones, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, etc. Fetal bovine serum is usually used as this medium. Since the serum should preferably be sterile, the blood of calves' fetuses is used instead of the cow’s blood.\u003cbr\u003eA pregnant cow is killed and the uterus is removed. Then the fetus is removed from the uterus, the umbilical cord is cut and disinfected. After that the heart is punctured with a needle and the blood is pumped out. Sometimes a pump is used for this, sometimes a massage. After the blood coagulates, platelets and coagulation factors are separated from it by centrifugation. Fetal bovine serum is what remains as a result.\u003cbr\u003eApart form the necessary components, the serum can also contain viruses, bacteria, yeast, fungi, mycoplasmas, endotoxins, and possibly [prions==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion].

However, it turns out that, unlike adult rabbits, who die of anoxia within 1.5 minutes, prematurely born rabbits can live without oxygen for 44 minutes. This happens because fetuses and newborns compensate for oxygen deficiency with anaerobic metabolism. Moreover, fetal brain consumes much less oxygen than adult brain. Other species of animals show similar results, but calves have never been examined specifically.\u003cbr\u003eScience has only recently raised the issue of whether a mammal’s fetus or newborn feels pain. Just ten years ago, infants were believed to be less sensitive to pain than adults, which is why surgeries on premature and full-term infants were performed without anesthesia. Today, it is believed that human fetus can feel pain as early as 24th week of pregnancy, and can suffer starting from week 11 after conception.  Moreover, fetuses and newborns are more sensitive to pain than adults, since they have not yet [developed==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception] a mechanism for suppressing physiological pain. Therefore, a fetus can even feel pain form a simple touch.\u003cbr\u003eThe authors conclude that normal brain activity is observed in fetus when its heart is being punctured, it feels pain and suffers when the blood is pumped out, and maybe even after the procedure, until it dies.\u003cbr\u003eThe authors then discuss whether it is possible to anesthetize the fetus, so that it would not feel pain.

This toxin increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, rendering this barrier more penetrable to other toxins and viruses. In fact, the pertussis toxin itself is a neurotoxin.\u003cbr\u003e- Since the 1930s, it has been known that the whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) is somewhat dangerous and can lead to neurological consequences.\u003cbr\u003e- Since the 1950s, scientists analysed DTP vaccine toxicity in mice, evaluating toxicity based on mice survival and weight. In 1963, it became apparent that there was no correlation between the results in mice and the number of neurological consequences in children.\u003cbr\u003e- In addition to the pertussis toxin (an exotoxin – a toxin that is secreted by a living bacterium), the vaccine component itself contains an endotoxin (a toxin released from a bacterium only after its decay). This endotoxin, whose presence was carefully concealed by the vaccine manufacturers, is in fact, very toxic.\u003cbr\u003e- In an article from 1953, it was stated that practically every vaccinated child suffered systemic intoxication, with often permanent CNS lesions.\u003cbr\u003e- The first acellular vaccine appeared in 1937. While it was widely used in the 1940s, it was later discontinued as the company did not want to invest in clinical trials. In the 1960s and 1970s, other acellular vaccines were widely used, but also got withdrawn from production due to their higher costs.\u003cbr\u003e- After two babies died from vaccination in Japan, the Japanese developed the acellular vaccine that has been used since 1981.\u003cbr\u003e- Sweden banned the whole-cell vaccine in the late 1970s. From 1970 to 1985, no child died of pertussis.\u003cbr\u003e- In Tennessee in 1979, four children died after being vaccinated with the same lot of the pertussis vaccine. At this point, the CDC discovered that the vaccine was associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). While the director of the vaccine department of the FDA was on vacation, the FDA decided to withdraw the entire lot from circulation. However, when the director returned, he ordered that the whole lot be returned for distribution, apologizing to the pharmaceutical companies and promising them that it would not happen again. After this incident, manufacturers stopped sending entire lots to the same place, and instead, began distributing each lot throughout the country.\u003cbr\u003e- This paper is also about how the pertussis vaccine led to the approval of a law for compensating victims of vaccinations. It also mentions how the Department of Health does everything possible to not compensate the injured, how almost all vaccine experts have a conflict of interest, and how the experts of committees investigating vaccine side effects are selected, and much more. The United States switched to the safer, acellular vaccine in 2001, 60 years after it was developed, and 20 years after Japan started using it. Nonetheless, not only is the whole-cell vaccine still licensed in the US, but pharmaceutical companies still sell the vaccine to the WHO, who then distribute it to other countries whose residents are improperly informed about the potential risks.","info_place":"J Hist Med Allied Sci.","I_S_codenames":["DTP_vaccine","SIDS"],"infoID":"12211972"},{"header":"Effectiveness","info_place":"PNAS","num":6.0,"info_authors":"Warfel","digest":"This is one of the most important studies because not only was it conducted by the FDA, but it also directly compares vaccinated subjects with unvaccinated ones, albeit baboons.

Let´s consider leprosy, a disease for which there is no vaccine. Leprosy, roughly speaking, can be of two kinds - tuberculoid or lepromatous. Tuberculoid leprosy is a relatively mild form of the disease in which only the skin is affected, and can often pass without treatment. Lepromatous leprosy, on the other hand, is more severe. In the kind of the disease, all mucous membranes become affected, and the outcome is often lethal. Intermediate forms between these two kinds of the disease are also possible.\u003cbr\u003eWhat determines whether a person will develop tuberculoid leprosy or lepromatous leprosy? The answer to this question is straight forward: the reaction of the individual´s immune system in response to the bacterium.\u003cbr\u003eThe immune system is divided into two subsystems: cellular immunity and humoral immunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eHumoral immunity\u003c/b\u003e is the immunity mediated by antibodies and other molecules.

This phenomenon is called \"[original antigenic sin==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin]\". In the case of whooping cough, after the pertussis bacterium settles in the airways, one of the toxins that it secretes, namely adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), deceives the immune system so that it doesn´t recognise pertussis as a pathogen. After two weeks, however, the immune system realizes that it was deceived, and begins to fight against the pertussis infection. The next time the immune system will come across ACT, it will not be deceived and will immediately suppress the pathogen. Thus, an individual will not become infected a second time. However, since there is no ACT in the vaccine, the immune system of the vaccinated individual does not yet know how to react to it, and the vaccinated individual becomes infected with whooping cough. Now, as a result of original antigenic sin, the immune system in this case will never learn how to respond effectively to pertussis.\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, the more doses an individual receives, the greater the effect of original antigenic sin.

However, vaccination achieves the opposite goal. First, instead of contracting pertussis once, and forgetting about it for the rest of your life, vaccinated children and adults can become sick with pertussis many times over. Moreover, since the disease often asymptomatic, they become a \"quiet reservoir\" of infection, spreading the disease to their families, and to infants. And the more vaccine doses they receive, the more they are susceptible to infection. Instead of alienating a brother who has fallen ill with whooping cough from an infant, it is difficult to diagnose a brother because of an atypical course of the disease, because of the changed definition of the disease, and simply because many doctors are unwilling to diagnose whooping cough in vaccinated patients.\u003cbr\u003e-DTP is the most reactogenic of all existing vaccines.\u003cbr\u003e- DTaP contains aluminum, and DPT also ethyl mercury.\u003cbr\u003e- The risk of dying after vaccination, even with the DTaP, is much greater than the risk of dying from pertussis itself.\u003cbr\u003e- In recent years, the number of cases of whooping cough has been steadily increasing. This is not because of the appearance of antivaxxers, but rather because more people are being vaccinated against pertussis. We vaccinate pregnant women, parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts, and even introduce extra booster vaccinations for children into the existing vaccination schedule. The more doses an individual receives of this vaccine, the further their immunity shifts towards Th2, and the more they become susceptible to the disease.","editdate":{"$date":"2020-04-07T13:39:31.755Z"},"translated":1,"interpreter":"Test","interpreter_link":"","I_S_namespace":"Vaccination"}

The article is long, but very informative, and is worth reading in full. \u003cbr\u003e- PAP smear is a test that determines whether one has dysplasia. In developed countries where it is widely used, the risk of death from cervical cancer is very low (1.4/100,000 women). 90% of deaths from cervical cancer are recorded in third world countries. (The risk of disease is also very low – 7/100,000 women. Moreover, the death rate from cervical cancer continues to fall rapidly. In the 90s, without any vaccinations, it decreased by half.) \u003cbr\u003e- An even bigger reduction of mortality from cervical cancer due to vaccinations in the developed countries is highly unlikely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eEffectiveness:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Since the development of cervical cancer takes decades, and pharmaceutical companies do not want to wait so long, surrogate markers (i.e. dysplasia CIN 1-3, which develop faster) are used instead of cancer in vaccine clinical trials. But since the vast majority of these dysplasias pass on their own, they are a pretty bad marker for cervical cancer.\u003cbr\u003e- The test for dysplasia, especially CIN 2, is very imprecise, which also makes it a bad marker. \u003cbr\u003e- Therefore, the effectiveness of a vaccine, determined on the basis of dysplasia, is not an indication of the effectiveness of the vaccine against cervical cancer. \u003cbr\u003e- Analyzing clinical trials, the effectiveness of Gardasil in preventing CIN 2-3, associated with any strain of HPV, was only 14-17%. (This is the actual effectiveness of the vaccine. But even this number is too high, as dysplasia does not always develop into cancer.)\u003cbr\u003e- Effectiveness of the vaccine for those, who have already been infected with HPV, was negative (from -33% to -44%). That is, for those already infected, vaccine increases the risk of dysplasia. These results were not mentioned in the article published my Merck. Nonetheless, FDA does not require testing for the infection before vaccinating.\u003cbr\u003e- Prevention of CIN 1-3 from 16/18 strains was at 100%. The statistical significance of these results, however, is rather doubtful. First of all, the confidence interval is very wide. The vaccine prevented 3 cases of CIN 1-3 in one group, and 7 cases in the other. Second of all, CIN 1 develops into cancer only in 1% of the cases. However, since the number of CIN 1 cases is much higher compared to the CIN 2-3 cases, summing up CIN 1 with CIN 2-3 completely distorts the statistics. \u003cbr\u003e- The authors further analyze clinical trials of the Cervarix vaccine, with similar conclusions. \u003cbr\u003e- After 7 years, the effectiveness of Cervarix in preventing CIN 2 was only 40.6%, with the confidence interval (-106.0 to 84.7) (no statistical significance). \u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eSafety:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- From 2006 to 2012 more than 20,000 cases of adverse events of this vaccine have been reported in the USA, 8% of them were serious ones. 73 people died, 581 became disabled. Since the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is passive, it records only 1% to 10% of all cases, according to various estimates. Therefore, the real amount of adverse events is 10-100 times higher. \u003cbr\u003e- Out of all vaccine adverse events in girls aged 6-29 years, 65% of all serious adverse events are due to HPV vaccine. \u003cbr\u003e- 82% of disability cases of women under 30 are associated with HPV vaccine. \u003cbr\u003e- In Australia the amount of serious adverse events increased to 85% and due to HPV vaccination. The same is happening is other countries as well. \u003cbr\u003e-  In the Cervarix study, which included 9,000 women, 8% had serious adverse event, 32% had significant adverse event, 9% had a spontaneous abortion, 3% got a new chronic disease. Same adverse events were observed in the control group (which received the same vaccine, only without the antigen). \u003cbr\u003e- In the UK, adverse events from Cervarix were observed 8 times more often than from the MMR vaccine.","infoID":"23016780"},{"info_type":"article","num":12.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24395857","info_authors":"Mahmud","info_date":"2014","title":"Effectiveness of the Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Against Cervical Dysplasia in Manitoba, Canada.","info_place":"J Clin Oncol","digest":"Another study proving the low effectiveness of Gardasil and negative effectiveness for those already infected with HPV. \u003cbr\u003eRegarding the negative effectiveness of the vaccine for those already infected, the CDC [writes==https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm]: “The vaccine is less effective in preventing HPV-related disease in young women who have already been exposed to one or more HPV types. ‘Less effective’, according to CDC, means negative effectiveness.

This is confusing, since the epidemiological study, conducted by the CDC themselves, found a 7.6-times increase in the risk of autism in children, who received vaccines with thiomersal. The same study found that the risk of inorganic sleep disorders was 5 times higher, the risk of speech disorders was 2.1 times higher, and the risk of neurological disorders was 1.8 times higher.\u003cbr\u003eThe CDC’s position is based on 6 epidemiological studies, which they funded themselves. All these studies are analyzed in the article:\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003cb\u003eMadsen, 2003\u003c/b\u003e. The authors analyzed the data from psychiatric clinicс in Denmark from 1971 to 2000, and determined that after the removal of thiomersal from the vaccines (in 1992), the incidence of ASD increased.  However: \u003cbr\u003e- The data from 1971 to 1994, only included inpatient diagnoses, while starting in 1995, they also included outpatient diagnoses. Thus, the inclusion criteria expended significantly 2 years after the removal of thiomersal, which created an artificial increase in the autism incidence. There were 4-6 times more outpatients than inpatients. Another study by the same authors analyzing the same data, reported that there were 13.5 times more outpatients. A large Copenhagen clinic, which registered 20% of the ASD patients in Denmark, was only included in the study in 1993, which also artificially inflated the number of autism cases after the removal of thiomersal. The authors do not report it, nor do they correct this anomaly. \u003cbr\u003e- Diagnostic criteria for ASD changed in 1994 (during the transition from ICD-8 to ICD-10). This could cause a 25-fold increase in the number of ASD cases. \u003cbr\u003e- The 2001 data, which showed a decline in the autism rate since 1991, was included in the first version of the article, which was submitted to JAMA. JAMA rejected the article and the authors submitted it to the Pediatrics. One of the reviewers at Pediatrics noticed that the authors do no analyze the decrease in the autism incidence, which could point to the possibility that removal of thiomersal could have played a role in it. In response to this, the authors removed the 2001 data from the article and it got published. If the authors had not removed this data, the results of the study would have been consistent with the results of a more recent study, according to which, the autism incidence in Denmark after 1992 decreased from the peak 1.5% in 1994 to 1% in 2002-4. \u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cb\u003eStehr-Green, 2003.\u003c/b\u003e Conducted in response to a California study, which discovered a correlation between thiomersal and autism. The authors compared the data from 3 countries (Denmark, Sweden and California). Danish data was the same as in the previous study. Swedish data was based only on inpatient cases (that is, on just a small fraction of all ASD cases). Part of the data from California was excluded from the final publication. \u003cbr\u003e3) \u003cb\u003eHviid, 2003.\u003c/b\u003e The authors state that the mean age of autism diagnosis is 4.7 years, but nonetheless, they included 1-year-olds in the analysis. Moreover, rather than counting the number of children, they counted the number of person-years. Thanks to this technique, each group was considered equally, despite the fact that the probability of diagnosis in younger age groups was much lower. \u003cbr\u003e4) \u003cb\u003eAndwers, 2004.\u003c/b\u003e A retrospective study in the United Kingdom.

However, the first phase of this study, released in an internal presentation, showed that infants who received more than 25 μg of mercury in vaccines and immunoglobulin at the age of one month, had 7.6-fold higher risk of autism, as compared to those who did not receive any mercury. The second phase of the study showed that infants, who received 62.5 μg of mercury before the age of three months, had 2.5-fold higher risk of autism, as compared to those who received less than 37.5 μg. In the third phase, after playing around with statistics, the risk of autism decreased to 1.69. Apparently, the author had been under pressure, since he wrote in an internal CDC correspondence: “I do not wish to be the advocate of the anti-vaccine lobby and sound like being convinced that thimerosal is or was harmful, but at least I feel we should use sound scientific argumentation and not let our standards be dictated by our desire to disprove an unpleasant theory.”\u003cbr\u003eThe fourth and fifth phases of the study were based on partial data only and included children at the age of 0-3 years old, even though the average age for autism diagnosis at the time was 4.4 years.

According to the new WHO criteria, only adverse events that had already been published in scientific articles may be recognized as vaccination adverse effects. Both the DTP insert and the pentavalent vaccine insert do not list death as a possible adverse effect, so it is of no surprise that no investigated death cases have been recognized as caused by vaccines.\u003cbr\u003eThe pentavalent vaccine was also introduced in Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Viet Nam, and in all these countries it was associated with adverse effects, including unexplained deaths. There have been sporadic deaths cases shortly after this vaccination in India as well, including the death of two infants the day after the vaccination. WHO had investigated these cases and concluded that they are unlikely to be related to vaccination. 3 deaths in Sri Lanka were initially recognized as likely caused by the vaccine. WHO then revised the algorithm for determining vaccine adverse effects in 2013, and these deaths were reclassified as unrelated to vaccination.

Possible mercury poisoning is also mentioned (this hypothesis was first [expressed==https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1999251] in 1846, and then again in 1922).

The authors explain, that some medications that are tolerated well by most, might, after all, be dangerous, to some people. They mention mercury diuretics, thousands of doses of which were administered to patients without any visible side effects, but sometimes yet another one of those injections caused sudden death. \u003cbr\u003eThe 1966 [article==https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/501896] dedicated to the already eradicated acrodynia, reports that this disease was a fascinating mystery to a generation of pediatricians. The theory of mercury, as a cause of acrodynia, was accepted slowly, with resistance, hesitation and even ridicule. Only after the ban on mercury did acrodynia disappear, without fanfare and festivities. At the end of the article, the author, who determined the final relationship between mercury and acrodynia 16 years earlier, asks the following question: “Is there really scientific evidence of the truthfulness of this theory? We, who believed in this theory for a long time, collected pieces of evidence, and then predicted that the disease will disappear, when mercury is removed from homes as a regular product and medical panacea. And acrodynia did disappear. But is it scientific proof? After all, so much has changed since the 1950s, that we might be attributing it to the wrong reason. And those who believe in the viral theory of acrodynia can argue that epidemics come and go, and now we are in a period of the natural decline of the disease.

He coined the new word “allergy” to mean the following: the first contact of immune system with an antigen changes its reactivity, and with repeated and subsequent contacts, this change (or allergy) can cause a spectrum of reactions, from protective (immune) to hypersensitive. At first, the scientific community did not understand this concept, as it undermined the idea of protective nature of the immune response.

It seems that science was unable to explain, overcome and resolve the fears associated with vaccination that arose more than two hundred years ago. \u003cbr\u003eThe term molecular mimicry was borrowed from natural sciences. Mimicry explained how an insect avoids being eaten, reminding the enemy of something they usually do not eat. Raymond Damian transferred this concept to molecular immunological context in 1960. He suggested that parasites avoid immune response due to the similarity of their antigens to host antigens. That is, the term molecular mimicry initially indicated the phenomenon of camouflage in order to avoid recognition. \u003cbr\u003eIn 1962, however, other researchers suggested that infections could cause autoimmune diseases due to the formation of cross-reactive antibodies. According to the new interpretation of the concept of molecular mimicry, the immune system recognizes and attacks pathogen structures, not paying attention to the fact that the host has similar structures, which causes autoimmune disease. However, after three decades of intensive research in this area, a causal relationship between molecular mimicry and autoimmune disease still has not been proven. \u003cbr\u003eIn recent years, it has been found that most viral and bacterial peptides are also found in human [proteome==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteome] (a set of body proteins). Only less than 10% of viral pentapeptides are unique to viruses, and only 0.3% of bacterial hexapeptides are unique to bacteria, and are not found in the human proteome. \u003cbr\u003e(Pentapepdite/hexapeptide is a chain of five/six amino acids. 5-6 amino acids is the minimum length of an antigen). That is, only a tiny part of approximately 30,000 proteins, which form the human proteome do not contain bacterial hexapeptides.\u003cbr\u003eThis massive similarity between viral and bacterial peptides and human peptides, points to the fragility of the molecular mimicry hypothesis, and proves Damian’s suggestion, according to which, the parasite antigens do not trigger an immune response due to the similarity with the host peptides. If the molecular mimicry hypothesis were true, 100% of people would be suffering from autoimmune diseases. Almost all epitopes (part of the antigen that is recognized by the immune system) are located in areas with low antigen similarity. Immunological information is packaged in rare peptides. Therefore, vaccination, which induces an immune response to whole viral or bacterial antigens, can cause a wide range of immune responses. \u003cbr\u003eThe similarity of infectious peptides to human ones can also explain why vaccines based on infectious antigens can trigger a weak immune response, or not trigger one at all. This meager vaccine immunogenicity has necessitated the use of adjuvants. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, the adjuvant-induced hyperactivation of the immune system can alter the tolerogenic mechanism that keeps the immune system under control and prevents harmful autoimmune reactions. Therefore, after the adjuvant vaccination, because of the massive similarity of microbe and human peptides, specific reactions can begin against the molecules or organs of the vaccine recipient, thus triggering autoimmune processes. The type of autoimmune disease will depend on the affected molecules or organs. For example, a reaction to myelin and its associated structures can cause demyelinating diseases, while an immune response against proteins and antigens that influence behavior or cognition can cause ASD or behavioral disorders. \u003cbr\u003eTo summarize: peptide similarity, microbe evasion of the immune system, low vaccine efficacy, the use of adjuvants and autoimmune cross-reaction can form a vicious cycle leading to autoimmunity post vaccination.

In China, for example, only rare, sporadic cases are observed, even though Western doctors work in many cities there and could not have missed such epidemics among the local populations if they occurred.

If the patient had flaccid paralysis, he was diagnosed with paralytic poliomyelitis. And if the lymphocyte count in the cerebrospinal fluid was elevated, then it was a non-paralytic poliomyelitis. It is known today, that this kind of laboratory diagnosis is typical of viral meningitis, but in no way indicates polio. Only when the epidemics began to subside, did they start checking for poliovirus. This caused an over-diagnosis of poliomyelitis during epidemics. Any type of paralysis - peripheral neuropathy, stroke, brain or spinal cord tumor, multiple sclerosis, hysterical paralysis and many other diseases could be diagnosed as polio. It was difficult to refuse the polio diagnosis, because of the generous financial assistance to polio patients, which was not available to patients with other types of paralysis. Many kinds of medicine were used for treatment of poliomyelitis, including strychnine, curare, cobra venom, and various antibiotics. The effectiveness of these drugs was based on anecdotal information, but was offered with confidence. One of the common types of treatment was muscle and spinal cord radiation. In the 20th century, casts and medical splints were used in cases of acute polio.  Paralyzed patients lay in casts for months, which caused atrophy of muscles that were no longer paralyzed. For most patients, the worst part was not the disease itself, but rather the isolation from family and friends. They felt abandoned. Fear of poliomyelitis led to the fact that even medical personnel avoided the patients. Newspapers of those days documented fear and mass hysteria. Poliomyelitis was the sword of Damocles raised over each child and adult. One of the newspapers wrote in 1948 that due to the epidemics, the whole city should be closed off and children should not leave their homes.

After the clinical trials, NFIP gave the committee two hours to review the materials, after which six companies were licensed to produce the Salk vaccine.\u003cbr\u003eTwo weeks after the license was issued, some children, vaccinated with Cutter Laboratories vaccine, were paralyzed. The vaccine was withdrawn, but 380,000 children had already been vaccinated with it. Subsequently, it turned out that 40,000 of them got polio, 200 were paralyzed and 10 died, because the vaccine was not sufficiently inactivated and contained active virus. Wyeth vaccine also caused paralysis and death in some cases. Other companies had difficulties with virus inactivation as well. Too little amount of formaldehyde did not kill the virus, while too much of it made the vaccine useless. Residues of various substances in the vaccine protected the viral particles from formaldehyde. Since other vaccine manufacturers threatened the newspapers to reduce the amount of advertising, it was decided to put all the blame on Cutter. Even though Cutter’s negligence was not proved, the court ordered Cutter to pay compensation. Overtime, this led to an abundance of lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers, which resulted in a law being passed in 1986, according to which it became impossible to sue vaccine manufacturers in the United States. Since then, compensation can only be received by filing a lawsuit with a special federal court, which is financed by the vaccine tax. However, one loophole remained. If the special court dismissed the claim, then it was possible to file a lawsuit against the company with a regular court. The already familiar to us Paul Offit [believes==https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764] that the loophole needs to be closed, since these lawsuits cost the companies millions of dollars and distract them from the manufacturing of such important products.","title":"A conversation with Paul Meier.

While a 24-hour paralysis was enough for diagnosis before, since 1955, the paralysis had to last at least 60 days. Since most cases of paralysis are short-term, polio incidence decreased with no connection to the vaccine. Coxsackie viruses and aseptic meningitis, which were previously considered polio, were assigned a separate category. The definition of epidemic also changed. While 20 cases were previously required to declare an epidemic, now it was 35 cases. \u003cbr\u003e2) Of the thousand people infected with poliovirus, only one gets paralysis. \u003cbr\u003e3) The number of paralytic poliomyelitis cases increased significantly in 1958-59, which was blamed on the unvaccinated. This is quite strange, as one of the participants observes, since the number of unvaccinated people has decreased drastically. So, if the vaccine was responsible for the 1955-57 decrease in incidence, how come the much higher number of unvaccinated people did not prevent it from decreasing in those years? \u003cbr\u003e4) Clinical trials of Salk vaccine only tested for its efficacy, since it was assumed that the vaccine was safe. It was determined that the vaccine is 72% effective against paralytic poliomyelitis, and ineffective against non-paralytic. However, after licensing of the vaccine, its composition was changed and another degree of filtration was added.  No one knows how this affected the vaccine efficacy. Filtration was added in hopes of removing the residual active virus, even though the effectiveness of this procedure has not been confirmed experimentally. Each filtration is known to significantly reduce the amount of antigen. An Israeli study found that an addition of filtration reduces the amount of antigen by 10-30 times, and there initially was little antigen in the vaccine. \u003cbr\u003e5) In 1954, active virus was found in 10 out of 48 tested vaccine batches. Different laboratories found active virus in different batches. Nonetheless, since Salk reported that 7,500 children had been vaccinated without side effects, the clinical trials were continued. Theoretically, inactivation of virus with formalin is a first-order chemical reaction. That is, if X hours are needed to inactivate 50% of the virus, then the next X hours will inactivate 50% of the remaining virus. However, this has not been confirmed practically. Everyone believed Salk, and no one double-checked his data, which subsequently led to the Cutter incident. Vaccines for clinical trials passed a triple safety check. After the licensing, this check was cancelled for the subsequent batches. Therefore, it is not surprising that there were outbreaks of vaccine paralysis. What is surprising is that there were not more of them. \u003cbr\u003e6) A virulent strain is required to produce antibodies. On the other hand, virulent strain causes epidemics of vaccine paralysis among those, who do not have antibodies. \u003cbr\u003e7) 57% of vaccinated people do not develop serotype 1 antibodies, 20% do not develop serotype 2 antibodies, and 77% do not develop serotype 3 antibodies. There is no difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated people with regard to serotypes 1 and 3. \u003cbr\u003e8) In 1956, in turned out that the potency of vaccines of various manufacturers differed by 600 times. In 1957, the major vaccine manufacturers had products worth several millions of dollars, the potency of which was below the established minimum. FDA has reduced the required potency, so that the products could be sold. \u003cbr\u003e9) In comparing the incidence among vaccinated and unvaccinated people, they forgot to count 100,000 unvaccinated, which led to overestimated efficacy. The decrease in the polio incidence is the result of manipulating the statistics. \u003cbr\u003e10) It is very difficult to convince doctors to diagnose non-paralytic poliomyelitis in those vaccinated. In 1956-57, it turned out that most cases of non-paralytic poliomyelitis were actually the Coxsackie virus and echovirus.\u003cbr\u003e11) During the 1958 epidemics in Israel, there was no difference in the incidence among those vaccinated and unvaccinated. During the epidemics in Massachusetts, paralysis was more common among those triple vaccinated than those unvaccinated. \u003cbr\u003e12) Trials of inactivated vaccines against Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus and Japanese encephalitis, have shown that when the number of viral particles in a vaccine was less than 100 million, vaccinated guinea pigs and mice died faster than unvaccinated. The vaccine caused sensitization, so the susceptibility to the disease only increased due to vaccination. This immunological fact has been confirmed by public health service. That is, insufficient efficacy of the vaccine does more harm than good. This is probably what happened in Massachusetts, where 47% of paralysis cases were observed among those vaccinated.  There were 10-30 millions of viral particles in the Salk vaccine, and that is before the additional degree of filtration was introduced. \u003cbr\u003e13) Director in the FDA did not want to license the vaccine, since he could not get Salk to answer his questions, but the management reversed his decision. \u003cbr\u003e14) The public is confident in the high effectiveness of the vaccine, although we know this is far from the case. The public is difficult to convince of the benefits of something, so it is better not to include it in the discussion of these issues.","info_authors":"Ratner"},{"num":12.0,"digest":"In 1952, 3,145 people [died==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_poliomyelitis] of poliomyelitis during the largest epidemic in the USA.

Я полагаю, что главной причиной полиомиелита является питание.\u003cbr\u003e- Хотя эпидемии часто заканчиваются после массовых вакцинаций, невозможно знать, что бы случилось, если бы их не было. Ведь в конце концов, все эпидемии заканчиваются.\u003cbr\u003e- В 1974 году, когда выяснилось, что эффективность OPV в Африке довольно низкая, ВОЗ объяснила это тем, что некая неизвестная субстанция в слюне или в грудном молоке подавляет размножение вируса.\u003cbr\u003e- Много раз в истории полиомиелита, вследствие многочисленных скоплений людей ожидались эпидемии, которые не происходили. Например в Цюрихе в 1941-м, и в Австралии в 1955-м.\u003cbr\u003e- Во время эпидемии 1916 года в Нью Йорке не заразился ни один медицинский работник, и ни один пациент попавший в больницу не по причине полиомиелита. То же самое наблюдалось в Дании в 1952-м. В исследовании 1957 года выяснилось, что никто из персонала инфекционной больницы не болел, несмотря на постоянное соприкосновение со страдающими недержанием пациентами. У 73% младенцев в Дели не было антител к полиовирусу, из чего следует, что можно быть здоровым даже в стране, где полиомиелит эндемический.\u003cbr\u003e- Современное объяснение эпидемии полиомиелита после второй мировой войны, это что население было восприимчиво к вирусу из-за недоедания. Однако множество фактов свидетельствуют о том, что полиомиелит был болезнью упитанных. Это было замечено еще в исследованиях в 1823-м и 1840-м. В 1945-м китайские дети болели намного больше креолов и индейцев, несмотря на более насыщенную диету.\u003cbr\u003e- Я пришел к выводу, что в каждом случае эпидемия может быть объяснена потреблением сахара. Когда я сам болел полиомиелитом, у меня появилось отвращение к сахару. То же самое происходило и с другими больными, которые были в основном сладкоежками. Если сахар действительно связан с эпидемиями, это объясняет все вышеупомянутые аномалии. Например, упитанные жертвы полиомиелита скорее всего налегают на сахар; превращение спорадических случаев полиомиелита в эпидемию согласовывается с мировым увеличением потребления рафинированного сахара.\u003cbr\u003e- 40% потребления сахара приходится на период между маем и августом, тогда как эпидемии происходят в конце лета. Также возрастная группа от 5 до 25 лет, которые обычно подвержены полиомиелиту, потребляет более 100 кг/год сахара, по сравнению со средним потреблением в 50 кг/год.\u003cbr\u003e- В странах третьего мира полиомиелит являлся \"тихой инфекцией\". Наблюдались лишь спорадические случаи, но не было никаких эпидемий. Но после второй мировой войны все изменилось, и эра \u0026quot;тихой инфекции\u0026quot; закончилась. В тот же период в этих странах произошла сахарная революция.\u003cbr\u003e- Далее рассказывается как сахарная свекла перерабатывается, и как сахар отбеливают с помощью серной кислоты и других химикатов. В случае бедного урожая сахарной свеклы, из нее приходится посредством многочисленных переработок выжимать последние кристаллы. Автор показывает, как за такими урожаями, и усиленной переработкой сахарной свеклы, следуют эпидемии полиомиелита. Например, до первой мировой войны Германия производила сахар для большинства европейских стран. Вследствие засушливого лета 1911 года, и усиленной переработки сахарной свеклы, поскольку контракты на поставку сахара нужно было выполнять, в 1911 году были эпидемии по всей Европе, кроме Франции, которая использовала свой собственный сахар. А в 1912-м были вспышки в Южной Америке, куда Германия экспортировала сахар.\u003cbr\u003eТо же самое произошло и в 1938 году в Германии и в Италии, и в 1952-м в Дании, Германии и Бельгии. Эпидемия 1916 года в Нью Йорке была следствием бедного урожая на Кубе в 1915-м.\u003cbr\u003e- В России сахарные фабрики простаивали с 1917 по 1926-й, но потом, для плана второй пятилетки, было решено возобновить производство. Урожай был бедным, и в 1927-м в России была эпидемия полиомиелита, а также в Румынии, восточной Германии и Польше, куда экспортировался российский сахар, и где эпидемий полиомиелита до этого вообще не было. То же самое было в Ямайке в конце 1950-х, в Ирландии в 1940-х, и в Тринидаде в 1971-м.\u003cbr\u003e- Импорт сахара в конце неурожайного года часто приводил к эпидемиям, Например в Италии в 1958-м, в Маврикии и в Южной Африке в 1944-м, и в Дании в 1961-м, где была вспышка полиомиелита несмотря на охват вакцинации в 99% среди детей до 14 лет и 90% среди всего населения.\u003cbr\u003e- После перехода населения от употребления коричневого сахара на белый также следовали эпидемии. Например на Ямайке после второй мировой воины, на Кубе в 1934-м, и на Филиппинах в 1958-м.\u003cbr\u003e- В ЮАР до апартеида, во время двух больших эпидемий 1918-го и 1944-1945-го белые болели полиомиелитом в 10 раз чаще негров. Негры употребляли в среднем 17 кг сахара в год, а белые 50 кг. То же самое наблюдалось на Гавайях - белые болели в два раза чаще аборигенов, которые употребляли коричневый сахар.\u003cbr\u003e- Клинические, эпидемиологические и лабораторные наблюдения показывают, что повышенный сахар в крови приводит к восприимчивости к полиомиелиту. В 1940-х годах считалось, что полиомиелит разносят мухи, и их травили ДДТ. Сначала это испробовали на африканской деревне, и после распыления ДДТ там началась эпидемия полиомиелита, хотя до этого наблюдались лишь спорадические случаи. То же самое произошло в Техасе в 1948-м. На Ямайке в 1954-м эпидемия полиомиелита началась после кампании распыления ДДТ для уничтожения комаров. Фармакологически ДДТ поднимает уровень сахара в крови. Женщины более восприимчивы к полиомиелиту во второй половине беременности, когда повышается уровень сахара в крови. Физический и умственный стресс также повышают и уровень сахара в крови, и восприимчивость к болезни.\u003cbr\u003e- Во время сухого закона в США было продемонстрировано, что симптомы полиомиелита могут быть вызваны ядом, без всякого вируса. Тогда алкоголь варили из имбиря, и впоследствии выяснилось, что он содержит производную фенола. Все случаи паралича были вызваны употреблением имбирного алкоголя за 10 дней до начала симптомов. Эффекты экстракта имбири были идентичны эффектам три-орто-крезилфосфата, который вызывал паралич у лабораторных животных и у телят. Симптомы болезни были идентичны симптомам полиомиелита.\u003cbr\u003e- Автор предполагает, что субстанция, ответственная за полиомиелит является дезоксисахаром (сахар, в котором гидроксильная группа (-OH) заменена водородом (-H)). Дезоксисахар по вкусу не отличается от обыкновенного сахара, однако организм его не узнает, и не вырабатывает инсулин, что приводит к повышению уровня сахара в крови. Употребление 60 мг/кг 2-дезоксиглюкозы может увеличить уровень сахара в крови в три раза. Известно, что спинномозговая жидкость больных полиомиелитом содержит подобные сахара.\u003cbr\u003e- Полиовирус это не то, что влияет на эпидемии полиомиелита. Об этом свидетельствуют аномалии заражения и провалы вакцинации. К болезни приводят большие количества употребляемого дезоксисахара, который особенно часто является производным в процессе рафинирования сахарного тростника, и поэтому жители развивающихся стран, где используется исключительно такой сахар, особенно уязвимы. Организм никак не может использовать дезоксисахар, но может его аккумулировать.","is_hidden":1,"info_authors":"van Meer","I_S_codenames":["sugar"]},{"info_place":"Am J Pathol","title":"The production of neuronal injury and necrosis with the virus of poliomyelitis in rabbits during insulin hypoglycemia.","infoID":"PMC1965163","info_date":"1941","info_type":"article","num":29.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1965163/","digest":"Недоедание и гипогликемия тоже повышают восприимчивость к полиомиелиту.

Несмотря на согласованные усилия, полиовирус в Индии не смогли искоренить. Возможно, вместо того, чтобы снова и снова сдвигать крайний срок искоренения, пришло время остановиться и задуматься, почему эта цель не достигается. Мы полагаем, что у этого есть 4 причины.\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003ci\u003eНеэффективность живой вакцины.\u003c/i\u003e Уже в 1960-х было известно, что в странах с теплым климатом OPV менее эффективна. В Уганде в начале 70-х сероконверсия (появление антител в крови) вакцины была очень низкой, и улучшилась лишь когда вместе с вакциной стали давать оральный лошадиный антисерум, который нейтрализовал ингибиторы вируса в слюне у детей.\u003cbr\u003eВ 1989 году, 14% детей заболевших паралитическим полиомиелитом были привиты как минимум тремя дозами. В 1994-м их количество выросло до 22%. В Раджастане количество детей с паралитическим полиомиелитом после шести и более доз вакцины составляло 25% в 1999 году, и 58% в 2000-м.\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003ci\u003eВысокая заболеваемость вакциноассоциированным полиомиелитом.\u003c/i\u003e Считается, что ВАПП обычно происходит лишь после первой дозы вакцины. Однако в 1999 году из 181 случаев ВАПП лишь у девяти он наступил после первой дозы вакцины, у 51 паралич наступил от последующих доз, а остальные 121 лишь контактировали с привитыми.\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003ci\u003eСопротивление вакцинации.\u003c/i\u003e Некоторые родители верят, что вакцина приводит к бесплодию. Эти страхи антинаучны и невежественны. В добавок дети получают бесчисленное количество доз вакцины, и родители начинают сомневаться в ее эффективности, а также в том, знают ли власти, сколько доз необходимы для защиты.\u003cbr\u003eВо время массовых кампаний вакцинации, прививают также очень больных детей. И когда такой ребенок умирает, родители ошибочно полагают, что он умер из-за вакцины, и это негативно сказывается на кампании вакцинации.\u003cbr\u003eРодителям известны два факта: а) многие дети заболели полиомиелитом несмотря на многочисленные дозы вакцины, б) некоторые дети заболели полиомиелитом сразу после прививки.\u003cbr\u003e4) \u003ci\u003eНедоступность инактивированной вакцины.\u003c/i\u003e Несмотря на то, что IPV дороже (OPV стоит 10 центов, а IPV 10 долларов), многие дети заболели полиомиелитом хотя были привиты более 10 раз, поэтому вопрос цены становится нерелевантным. Более того, детям дают 5 доз DTP, и собираются вводить вакцину от гепатита В, и никого не смущает их высокая стоимость.\u003cbr\u003eВ допрививочную эпоху паралитическим полиомиелитом болели главным образом дети из богатых семей, возможно из-за повышенной гигиены. Сегодня им болеют в основном дети из бедных семей. Если богатые действительно болели из-за повышенной гигиены, то в будущих вспышках богатые дети снова станут жертвами паралитического полиомиелита.\u003cbr\u003eПолиомиелит не может быть искоренен используемой сегодня программой, так как вакцина неэффективна, и сама по себе приводит к параличу."},{"info_place":"Bioethics","title":"Some ethical issues arising from polio eradication programmes in India.","infoID":"16222855","info_date":"2005","info_authors":"Paul","info_type":"article","num":39.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16222855/","info_geo":["India"],"is_hidden":1,"digest":"Программа ВОЗ по искоренению полиомиелита в Индии поднимает много этических вопросов.

Поскольку привитый ребенок выделяет вирус, им заражаются также те, с кем он контактирует. То есть каждый привитый человек продолжает распространять прививку далее.\u003cbr\u003eПравда в процессе распространения вакцинных штаммов вирус мутирует, и согласно японскому исследованию, 69% мутаций полиовируса серотипа 1, 92% мутаций серотипа 2, и 55% мутаций серотипа 3 оказались нейровирулентными.\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003ci\u003eИнформированное согласие.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003eВ Индии никто не информирует родителей о возможных рисках вакцинации. Рекомендации ВОЗ сосредотачиваются на пропаганде вакцинации, а про информированное согласие ВОЗ нигде не упоминает. Хотя уже давно известно, что прививка может привести к параличу, врачам в Индии советуют не сообщать этот факт народу, и обсуждать его только в академических кругах. Когда оказалось, что прививка вызывает больше случаев паралича, чем считалось ранее, один из учредителей Комитета Искоренения Полиомиелита заявил: \u0026quot;мы можем осмелиться опубликовать истинные цифры ВАПП только в том случае, если у нас есть альтернативная стратегия для незамедлительной реализации\u0026quot;.\u003cbr\u003eКонечно, если выгоды программы искоренения явно перевешивают ее вред, то может и не стоит информировать родителей. Но действительно ли это так? Чтобы ответить на этот вопрос необходимо выяснить:\u003cbr\u003eа) сколько случаев полиомиелита были предотвращены вследствие вакцинации? На этот вопрос ответить невозможно. Конечно, количество случаев полиомиелита в Индии упало с 13-38 тысяч в 80-х, до 1126 в 1999-м. Однако это произошло главным образом из-за изменения определения болезни. До 1990 года каждый случай острого вялого паралича (ОВП) классифицировался как полиомиелит, а потом стали считать лишь случаи вызванные полиовирусом. В 1996-м и в 1999-м определение полиомиелита снова изменилось. Однако количество случаев ОВП за эти годы не изменилось. Более того, сегодня количество случаев полиомиелита занижено, так как далеко не всегда доступны анализы стула. А случаи ВАПП вообще не считаются полиомиелитом. К тому же, многие из них ошибочно классифицируются как другие болезни.\u003cbr\u003eб) сколько случаев паралитического полиомиелита произошло несмотря на адекватную вакцинацию? В 1998-2003 годах 33-60% всех случаев паралича были у привитых четырьмя и более дозами вакцины.\u003cbr\u003eв) сколько случаев паралича были вызваны вакциной? В тех же годах было от 120-206 случаев в год, однако по некоторым оценкам их примерно 300 в год.\u003cbr\u003eДаже если выгода от искоренения вируса перевешивает утаивание информации о вреде вакцины, нужно хотя бы компенсировать родителей, если их дети заболевают ВАПП, или если они становятся инвалидами, или умирают от полиомиелита несмотря на то, что были полностью привиты."},{"info_place":"Science","title":"New strategies for the elimination of polio from India.","infoID":"17110580","info_date":"2006","header":"India","info_type":"article","num":40.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17110580","info_geo":["India"],"info_authors":"Grassly","digest":"An article, published in the Science magazine in 2006, reports that children in Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh receive 15 doses of polio vaccine on average before the age of five, and 10 doses in other states.

Therefore, worldwide vaccination will have to continue forever. Forcing poor countries to spend their meager resources on an impossible to achieve dream for the past 10 years was unethical. Moreover, despite the fact that there has not been a single case of poliomyelitis in India for a year now, there has been a huge increase in cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). 47,500 new cases have been registered in 2011, which is 12 times more than was expected. 25-35 times more cases of NPAFP are recorded in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh than in other countries, even though polio vaccination is given almost each month there.

Это, в свою очередь, приведет к необходимости прекращения вакцинации, особенно живой вакциной. Однако некоторые научные вопросы на тему, как и когда прекращать вакцинацию, все еще остаются без удовлетворительного ответа. Один из самых важных вопросов, это насколько долго будут существовать мутировавшие вакцинные штаммы полиовируса, которые останутся последними, и смогут ли они заражать непривитых детей в поствакцинальную эпоху, приводя к новым эпидемиям полиомиелита?\u003cbr\u003eОчень мало известно о молекулярной и генетической базе передаваемости полиовируса, и может ли мутировавший вакцинный штамм быть таким же заразным, как дикий.\u003cbr\u003eВ 1967-м году в Польше проводилось небольшие испытания нового штамма вакцины (USOL), который представлял собой альтернативу третьего серотипа штамма Сабина. Штамм Сабина генетически нестабилен, и иммунитет от него быстро пропадает. В результате испытаний выяснилось, что новый штамм эффективнее сабинского, и генетически более стабилен.\u003cbr\u003eОднако в мае-декабре 1968 года в Польше произошла вспышка паралитического полиомиелита (464 случая). По времени и по географии, она была связана с испытаниями нового штамма, которые проводились за 4 месяца до начала эпидемии. ВОЗ в то время не смог определить, была ли вспышка вызвана диким или вакцинным штаммом. И вот сейчас, когда доступен генетический анализ, выяснилось, что вспышка была вызвана вакцинным штаммом. Считается, что паралич бывает у одного из 200 зараженных диким штаммом, из чего следует, что небольшое испытание вакцины привело к заражению как минимум 90,000 людей. Возможно это было из-за того, что новый штамм, хоть и по всем параметрам лучше штамма Сабина, выделяется привитыми дольше, что и привело к эпидемии.\u003cbr\u003eИз этого следует, что некоторые люди, которые выделяют вирус более 10 лет после прививки, могут представлять собой серьезный риск возобновления эпидемий полиомиелита в поствакцинальную эпоху.","info_geo":["Poland"],"is_hidden":1,"I_S_codenames":["shedding"]},{"info_place":"Biologicals","title":"Vaccine-derived poliovirus from long term excretors and the end game of polio eradication.","infoID":"16650772","info_date":"2005","info_type":"article","num":51.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16650772/","digest":"Одним из фундаментальных оправданий искоренения полиовируса является тот факт, что вирус может заражать лишь человека, и если не останется ни одного зараженного, вирус будет искоренен.

Later, dozens of studies have been published, which found this virus in human tumors. SV40 is found in mesotheliomas, brain tumors, breast tumors, large intestine tumors, lymphomas and osteosarcomas, etc. Mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer of the lung pleura that cannot be treated by conventional methods, and causes death in 90% of the patients within 2 years. Each year 3,000 people get diagnosed with it in the USA, whereas until 1950 it was virtually non-existent.

The virus is usually found in tumors, but not in the healthy tissue surrounding them. \u003cbr\u003eSince 1963, the manufacturers have switched from the macaque kidneys to kidneys of other monkeys, and began to test vaccines for SV40.

However, even studies, that allegedly do not confirm the connection between SV40 and tumors, in fact, find SV40 (just a little of it), or find DNA of the virus instead of a virus protein, and wonder whether the presence of DNA is a sufficient carcinogenic factor.

Ирландский эксперимент пришлось прекратить, так как ослабленный вирус снова становился вирулентным. Затем в конце 50-х он тестировал вакцины на миллионах жителях бельгийского Конго (Заир). Случайным образом оказалось, что деревни, где вакцина тестировалась, очень совпадают с деревнями, где 30 лет спустя впервые обнаружился ВИЧ. Бельгийское Конго распалось в 1960-м, затем там началась гражданская война, и привитых детей никто в долгосрочном плане не исследовал.

From which it follows that the reason for the sudden virulence of the virus lies in the changing ecological conditions. Vaccines, injections of arsenic and antibiotics, removal of tonsils, insecticides and pesticides – all of these are factors that that led to the penetration of the intestinal virus into the nervous system, and to its sudden virulence.
