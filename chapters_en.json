Further studies on different foods led to the discovery of an \"anti-haemorraghic factor\", which was designated vitamin K (with the \"K\" standing for \"Koagulations-Vitamin\") given that it was essential for normal haemostasis.\u003cbr\u003eVitamin K1 is acquired through the diet and is prevalently present in leafy green vegetables such as spinach, Swiss chard, Brassica (e.g. cabbage, kale, cauliflower, turnip, and Brussels sprout), some fruits such as avocado, banana and kiwi, as well as in some vegetable oils, especially soybean oil. Many bacteria that colonize the human intestine synthesize vitamin K2 or menaquinone, There is, however, ongoing debate on whether bacterial synthesis of vitamin K in the intestine provides a significant supply of this vitamin in humans. \u003cbr\u003eAccording to the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin K is 120 μg in adult men and 90 μg in adult women, but it is much lower in other countries and Europe, where, for example, a daily average of ~1 μg per kg of body weight is recommended. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey set the thresholds of adequate vitamin K intake as 2 μg/day for infants in the first 6 months of life. Human breast milk contains between 1 and 4 μg/L of vitamin K1.\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the age of onset, there are three types of the desease that had been named \"Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB)\" in 1999.\u003cbr\u003e1) \u003ci\u003eEarly\u003c/i\u003e VKDB presents within 24 hours of birth and is almost exclusively seen in infants of mothers taking drugs which inhibit vitamin K. These drugs include anticonvulsants, antituberculosis drugs, some antibiotics and vitamin K antagonists (coumarin, warfarin). The clinical presentation is often severe with cephalic haematoma and intracranial and intra-abdominal haemorrhages. The incidence of early VKDB in neonates of mothers taking these drugs without vitamin K supplementation varies from 6% to 12%.\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003ci\u003eClassical\u003c/i\u003e VKDB occurs between 24 hours and 7 days of life and is associated with delayed or insufficient feeding. The clinical presentation is often mild, with bruises, gastrointestinal blood loss or bleeding from the umbilicus and puncture sites. Blood loss can, however, be significant, and intracranial haemorrhage, although rare, has been described. Estimates of the frequency vary from 0.25% to 1.5% in older reviews and 0–0.44% in more recent reviews.\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003ci\u003eLate\u003c/i\u003e VKDB is associated with exclusive breast-feeding. It occurs between the ages of 2 and 12 weeks. The clinical presentation is severe, with a mortality rate of 20% and intracranial haemorrhage occurring in 50%. Persistent neurological damage is frequent in survivors. In fully breast-fed infants who did not receive vitamin K at birth, the incidence is between 1/15,000 and 1/20,000. Babies with cholestasis or malabsorption syndromes are at particular risk.\u003cbr\u003eAs in other circumstances in science and medicine, there is an apparent paradox in haemostasis in neonates in that prolonged global coagulation tests do not translate into a particular bleeding phenotype. In fact, it is now clear that the physiology of haemostasis in childhood differs considerably from that in adults. Studies in humans and animals clearly indicate that coagulation factors in neonates are qualitatively similar to those in adults.

Despite such a lengthy track record, BCG vaccination has also generated at least as much controversy as any other form of immunisation. Most importantly, the capacity to protect individuals against tuberculosis is still debated, since randomised clinical trials have provided estimates ranging from 80% protection to no benefit. Traditionally, BCG vaccines have been considered among the safest in use. However, the true incidence of disease due to BCG strains (called “BCG-itis” or “BCG-osis”) is unknown.\u003cbr\u003eWith the concerns about BCG efficacy and safety have come calls for new vaccines against tuberculosis. Various new vaccine candidates have been developed and tested in animal models. Notably, of nearly 200 candidate vaccines tested to date, only one has provided better protection than BCG, a recombinant form of BCG itself.\u003cbr\u003eThe history of BCG begins with pathogenesis experiments by Calmette and Guerin in the first decade of the 20th century. To study tuberculosis in cattle, they worked with cultures of bovine tubercle bacilli (M. bovis), which explains why our present vaccines against M. tuberculosis are derived from closely related M. bovis. The importance of differences between M tuberculosis and M bovis in the derivation of a live, attenuated vaccine against human tuberculosis remains unknown.\u003cbr\u003eFor optimum oral infection of cattle and guineapigs, Calmette added a detergent, specifically bile, to the culture medium, to prevent the bacteria from clumping. Within a few months, an unusual colony type arose, which was less virulent to the guinea pigs. Calmette continued the process of growing these bacteria in the presence of bile, for 13 years, changing the nutrient medium every two weeks.\u003cbr\u003eBeginning in 1921, BCG was administered to people to prevent tuberculosis. At this time, it was not possible to freeze-dry (lyophilise) BCG or put away a stock of the strain in a freezer. Therefore, BCG continued to be grown in much the same conditions that had resulted in its original attenuation until the lyophilisation of BCG-Pasteur after 1173 passages in 1961.\u003cbr\u003eDuring these decades, the same poorly understood laboratory selective pressures that had created BCG in the first place were presumably still at work. Since Calmette first reported attenuation of virulence after 15 passages in vitro and reported further attenuation of virulence over the next 215 passages, was it possible that no further attenuation would happen during the subsequent 943 passages? Since neither the parent strain of M. bovis that gave rise to BCG nor the original BCG of 1921 are available for study, this question cannot be answered directly.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1924, BCG lots began to be distributed to various different countries for local preparation of vaccine. BCG was propagated at these laboratories in the same conditions as at the Pasteur Institute, with the same goals – namely to prevent BCG from reverting to virulence while preserving an acceptable degree of what was called “potency”. Over the course of a few decades, each of these BCG vaccine laboratories developed its own daughter strain of BCG, typically named after the laboratory director, the city, or the country.\u003cbr\u003ePresently, all BCG strains are prepared as lyophilised stocks that are resuspended before inoculation. The proportion of BCG vaccine that is dead versus live varies greatly after reconstitution. Most lyophilised BCG vaccines are 90–95% dead bacteria, but BCG-Tokyo is a notable exception, estimated to consist of perhaps 25% live bacteria at vaccination. The importance of the proportion of viable bacteria in the vaccine has yet to be formally assessed; for instance, does giving more dead bacteria compensate?\u003cbr\u003eIn the rational design of an attenuated vaccine, one would presumably attempt to remove virulence factors while maintaining antigens. It is known today that several antigenic proteins are either absent from all BCG strains or absent / not expressed in BCG vaccines obtained after 1931. The loss of antigens from certain BCG strains is apparently contrary to what would be desired and suggests an important phenotype for further study.\u003cbr\u003eThe other important phenotype of BCG strains is their safety, and more specifically the rate of BCG dissemination. One such experiment involved the replacement of BCG-Prague with BCG-Russia in the former country of Czechoslovakia. Rates of disseminated BCG disease, including BCG osteitis were greater with the Russian strain. An epidemic of BCG osteitis was also reported in Sweden and Finland in the 1970s, but not due to a change of strain, rather because the Swedish strain of BCG was sent to Copenhagen for production of vaccine. In Sweden, BCG vaccination was halted. In Finland, BCG vaccination continued, with a change to another BCG strain.\u003cbr\u003eHave BCG strains evolved over time? The answer is clearly yes. Does this matter? The answer depends on who is asked. A bacteriologist would be surprised if BCG has not changed considerably during a half-century of growth in the laboratory. For the person planning to administer BCG to an infant or the public-health official planning for the vaccination of millions of newborns, more information is needed. Is there a “most protective BCG”? Is there a “safest BCG”? Are these necessarily different? Unfortunately, answers to these questions cannot yet be given.\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether the future involves specific BCG strains, a genetically altered BCG, or a completely new vaccine, one hopes that those currently providing BCG vaccines will be prepared to validate laboratory observations in the field, so that we are not again left with the uncertainty of vaccinating millions each year without a clear understanding of its risks and benefits.","title":"BCG - different strains, different vaccines?","info_place":"Lancet Infect Dis","info_date":"2002","infoID":"11901655"},{"info_authors":"Lawn","info_place":"Lancet","num":2.0,"link":"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)62173-3/abstract","digest":"The BCG vaccine has been given to 4 billion people since 1921, and to more than 90% of the children in the world today, however, it has done little to contain the current tuberculosis pandemic.

All of these measures were used at sanatoria  and helped to cause and maintain a decline in mortality due to TB throughout the 19th century. Antibiotics and other chemical therapies were introduced in the 1940s and 1950s. However, their use caused the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Some strains have even been observed to be extensively drug resistant and are very difficult and expensive to treat (estimated cost US$500,000–1,000,000 per patient for hospital-based care in high-income countries). In Peru, the incidence of TB has declined 3.7% per year since 1996, but the incidence of cases with drug resistant strains has increased by 4.5%.

In Brazil and Japan antibiotics were effective in combination with conservative measures and public health interventions.\u003cbr\u003eIn Sierra Leone, the TB mortality rate had increased 3-fold in 20 years, despite availability of antibiotics, which are ineffective. The mortality rate in Japan had rapidly increased in the end of 19th to beginning of 20th centuries. This increase in mortality rate in Japan (and most probably in other countries before statistical data was being acquired) occurred during the initial heavy industrialization.","title":"Lessons from history of socioeconomic improvements: a new approach to treating multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.","info_place":"J Biosoc Sci","info_authors":"Holloway","info_date":"2014","infoID":"24103436"},{"info_authors":"Fox","info_place":"PLoS Pathog","num":5.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4721647/","digest":"In an accident later known as the Lübeck disaster, 251 neonates were orally given three doses of the new Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) antituberculosis (TB) vaccine contaminated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

First, while mortality was high (approximately 29%), the majority of neonates inoculated with M. tuberculosis eventually overcame TB disease. This shows the high constitutional resistance of humans to the bacillus. Second, while at low levels of M. tuberculosis there was a large spread of clinical phenotypes reflecting a good degree of innate resistance to TB, at the highest dose, the majority of neonates were highly susceptible to TB. This shows the dominating role of dose for innate resistance to TB. Third, two infants inoculated with the lowest dose nevertheless died of TB, and their median time from inoculation to death was substantially shorter than for those who died after inoculation with higher doses. This suggests that infants who developed disease after low dose inoculation are those who are most susceptible to the disease.","title":"Tuberculosis in Newborns: The Lessons of the \"Lübeck Disaster\".","info_geo":["Germany"],"info_type":"article","info_date":"2016","infoID":"PMC4721647"},{"info_place":"PLoS One","title":"The Association between Active and Passive Smoking and Latent Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children in the United States: Results from NHANES.","infoID":"PMC3963991","info_date":"2014","header":"Risk Factors","info_type":"article","num":6.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963991/","I_S_codenames":["smoking"],"info_geo":["US"],"info_authors":"Lindsay","digest":"Active and passive smoking is associated with a doubling of the risk of tuberculosis.

The trial results published in 2013 showed no evidence of added protection.\u003cbr\u003eBefore the 2009 efficacy trial in South African babies, it had been tested in mice, guinea pigs, cattle, and monkeys and had also undergone early phase safety and immunogenicity trials in humans. However, in 2015 an independent systematic review of eight studies using 192 animals published between 2003 and 2010 concluded that the data did not provide evidence to support efficacy of MVA85A as a BCG booster. Two studies showed significant protection, but in these MVA85A was given differently from the way it was given in humans. One was in guinea pigs and MVA85A was further boosted with a recombinant fowlpox virus. The other was a mouse experiment when both BCG and MVA85A were given intranasally rather than intradermally.\u003cbr\u003eIn a UK study in rhesus macaque monkeys, four of the six macaques given BCG alone survived to the end of the experiment. Worryingly, however, only one of the six macaques that received BCG plus MVA85A survived. This study raised the possibility that MVA85A was unsafe and actually impairing the effectiveness of BCG. All this was known to researchers for a year and a half before the start of tests on infants. Nevertheless, the researchers had suppressed this information when they presented the results at the TB conference in Vancouver in 2007, in funding applications and in applications for conducting human trials. They also failed to communicate it to the parents whose babies participated in the vaccine testing.\u003cbr\u003ePeter Beverley, at that time a principal research fellow at Oxford University, was warried about the absence of the data and repeatedly expressed his concerns about the macaque study. In response, the Oxford University shut down Beverley's laboratory. It also refused to provide the trial protocols to the BMJ.\u003cbr\u003e(Mind you, all this happened in Oxford – the most prestigious university in the world. One can only guess what are the practices in other universities and in the pharmaceutical companies' labs).","title":"Oxford TB vaccine study calls into question selective use of animal data.","info_place":"BMJ","info_geo":["UK","SouthAfrica"],"info_authors":"Cohen","info_date":"2018","infoID":"10.1136/ bmj.j5845"},{"info_type":"article","info_place":"Med Hypotheses","num":35.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10499822/","info_date":"1999","title":"Tuberculosis II: the failure of the BCG vaccine.","info_authors":"Maes","digest":"The rapid progress of the tuberculous endemy in the 1860s corresponds to the period of industrialization, urbanization and pauperism existing in Europe at that time. Initially, the two professions principally at risk were the lacemakers and the laundresses.\u003cbr\u003eKoch described the bacillus in 1882 and the tuberculin was presented as the first immunotherapeutic product against TB in 1890. The vaccinal treatment with tuberculin ended with the death of 55 of the first 1769 patients treated.\u003cbr\u003eA second candidate for TB vaccine was M. chelonae, live bacillus of Friedmann, which natural pathogenicity for mammals was weak. However the raise of antisemitism and of nationalism resulted in a lawsuit against Friedmann in 1937, the suppression of manufacture of the product in Italy at the demand of Hitler, the burning of the Friedman Institute in Leipzig and a French legal interdiction to use this vaccine, in favor of live attenuated M. bovis.\u003cbr\u003eChildren having developed a tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis after drinking milk contaminated with M. bovis appeared protected against more serious forms of pulmonary TB and thus became the third candidate for the TB vaccine. Calmette proceeded to attenuate the bovine bacillus by repeated subculture in vitro for 13 years. This live vaccine provoked a general lymphatic disease in the guinea-pig that was claimed to heal spontaneously within 3 weeks. On the basis of this observation, the vaccine was administered per os to human newborns, despite the fact that the BCG itself was shown to multiply during months in various organs of the guinea pig.\u003cbr\u003eCalmette refused to evaluate the consequences of this last observation. To monkeys at risk, the vaccine lent no protection at all, but Calmette refused to examine either the monkeys or the results. In children, the protective efficacy of the vaccine was wildly exaggerated: the occasional occurrence of meningitis cases in vaccinees was explained by contaminations with M. tuberculosis, which indeed occurred once and served as an explanation for all the cases.\u003cbr\u003eThe flaws in the experimental designs set up to prove the efficacy of the BCG, and the misuse of the statistics exploiting the results came to full light when Sweden discontinued the universal coverage of its population and analysed the effects of this measure: the adverse effects were tenfold superior to those commonly reported.\u003cbr\u003eThe chairman of UNICEF’s Subcommittee on Medical Projects was the brother of an influencial French politician who needed reconstruction money, pacific heroes and heroic achievements for a country that had emerged in discomfiture from World War II. The Pasteur Institute, BCG and Calmette fulfilled his expectations, and UNICEF offered $3 million to the WHO to endorse the vaccine. The WHO accepted the bribe and popularized the vaccine.\u003cbr\u003eThe undisputable epidemiological evidence of vaccine inefficacy shown by a regression of the endemy in non-covered countries at a rate similar to that observed in vaccinated populations was met with procrastination. No heed was given to the disastrous South-India trial (see paragraph 10 above). The claim that the BCG was totally innocuous paralysed the faculty of analysis concerning the BCGitis cases observed after vaccination.","infoID":"10499822"},{"info_place":"Arch Dis Child","title":"Unreliability of the Mantoux test using 1 TU PPD in excluding childhood tuberculosis in Papua New Guinea.","infoID":"PMC1626920","info_date":"1980","header":"Mantoux test","info_type":"article","num":36.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1626920/","info_geo":["PapuaNewGuinea"],"info_authors":"Murtagh","digest":"139 children in Papua New Guinea with bacteriological or histological proof of active tuberculosis were given the Mantoux tuberculin test.

In the RotaTeq vaccine strains, some human rotavirus segments are replaced with bovine rotavirus.

Only 10 particles are sufficient to get infected. This is why adults, who change babies’ diapers, are at risk of getting infected.

Fortunately, we have vaccines and antiviral drugs. \u003cbr\u003eVaricella resembles poliomyelitis, in a sense that a serious disease is partially a consequence of the progress in developed countries. The nature of the disease changed radically after Sydney Farber invented chemotherapy. The joy of the success was tainted when a boy, who survived chemotherapy, was killed by varicella, which can be deadly under conditions of immunodeficiency. When drugs that weaken immunity became widely used, varicella could no longer be considered a harmless rite of childhood. It became a disease that was feared and avoided. The first steps towards solving this iatrogenic problem were taken by Thomas Weller, who isolated the virus. This feat was a prerequisite for developing a vaccine. \u003cbr\u003eAs chemotherapy, steroids and antimetabolites, which are used to treat autoimmune diseases or to suppress immunity for organ transplantation, became more common, and the life expectancy increased, not only varicella, but also the shingles, turned into a significant clinical problem.

Advancing the health of one population group damages the health of another group. \u003cbr\u003eAlthough mass varicella vaccination program was launched in a few countries, while other countries wait for the final research results of the exogenous boosting effect, there has not been an attempt for an ethical analysis of vaccination. \u003cbr\u003eThe issue of vaccination cannot be solved by simple ethical rules, such as “respect for autonomy” (vaccinate) or “do no harm to others” (do not vaccinate). It requires a balance between competing interests of different groups, and thus, requires a more complex ethical approach. \u003cbr\u003eThe authors address this ethical issue through two fundamental ethical approaches: classic utilitarianism and contractualism. \u003cbr\u003eThe utilitarianism approach is based on two premises: (1) effect of the choice on the wellbeing (happiness and health) is the only aspect that really matters, and (2) the wellbeing of everyone is equally important. That is, increase in the average level of wellbeing is what’s important when choosing alternatives. \u003cbr\u003eTherefore, in case of the chickenpox, the question is whether vaccination will cause an overall decrease in varicella incidence. Despite the fact that empirical data from USA indicates an 88% decrease in chickenpox hospitalization rates and 74% decrease in chickenpox mortality rates, this data does not take into account the effect on the elderly. If it is taken into account, vaccination becomes less attractive, since it is estimated that the increase in the shingles incidence will exceed the decrease in the chickenpox incidence. \u003cbr\u003eTherefore, according to classic utilitarianism, mass vaccination is undesirable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the contractualism point of view, an ethical decision is not determined by the consequences, but rather by the justification in terms of principles and rules arising from the hypothetical ‘social contract.’ This contract is concluded between all people, and it defines the fundamental rules that should govern society. \u003cbr\u003eThat is, unlike the utilitarianism approach, what’s important is not the quantitative benefit of the vaccination, but whether its introduction can be justified by the generally accepted principles. These principles should also be acceptable to those who stand to be disadvantaged by them – adults and elderly. \u003cbr\u003eThe following considerations are examined: \u003cbr\u003e1) Freedom to protect one’s health (through vaccination).\u003cbr\u003e2) Responsibility. Elderly can vaccinate against shingles. This vaccine is considered to be safe. \u003cbr\u003e3) Unacceptable sacrifice. Some elderly would not be able to get protection against shingles (since the vaccine is not effective enough or contraindicated). These people would be sacrificed for the benefit of a large group of children. However, since the herpes zoster is rarely lethal, this sacrifice is acceptable. \u003cbr\u003e4) Uncertainly. Although exogenous boosting exists, its effect on the incidence of herpes zoster is less known than the effect of vaccination on varicella incidence. Therefore, it is possible to demand giving more importance to something already determined, that something that is not fully known yet. \u003cbr\u003eThus, from the contractualism point of view, mass vaccination is fully justified, since it is not clear why children should protect the elderly. Contractualism emphasizes impartial a priori rules, and not the a posteriori consequences, and therefore, depends less on the quantitative evaluations of these consequences. \u003cbr\u003eThe authors conclude that the decision to introduce vaccination should be based not only on quantitative data and research, but also on the ethical premises.","title":"Varicella-zoster virus vaccination under the exogenous boosting hypothesis: two ethical perspectives.","info_type":"article","info_date":"2014","infoID":"25454883"},{"header":"Benefits of varicella","num":30.0,"digest":"Several studies were cited in the measles section.

This is due to the fact that B2 cells do not synthesize antibodies without the signal of T-helper cells. In order for this to happen, the B2-cell, and its related T-helper cell, should recognize the same, or similar [epitope==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope]. But since T cells recognize only protein epitopes, T helper cells are usually able to activate B2 cells in response to protein antigens. In response to bacterial capsular polysaccharides, the immune system forms a response through cells B1 and MZB (Marginal zone B). B1 cells do not begin to react to bacterial carbohydrate antigens until 18-24 months, and their response does not fully mature until about 5 years of age. Therefore, infants and young children are unable to respond effectively to capsular bacteria. Conjugated vaccines use the fact that B2 cells and their related T helper cells do not have to respond to an identical epitope, but rather recognize closely related epitopes. Although the mechanisms by which conjugate vaccines work are not fully understood, it is believed that [antigen-presenting cells==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell], treat the combined protein carrier and carbohydrate [hapten==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapten], which leads to recognition of the protein carrier by T-helper cells, and recognition of carbohydrate antigens by B2 cells. That is, conjugated vaccines change the immunological response to carbohydrate antigens in infants and young children, from a hypo-sensitive to a full T cell response.\u003cbr\u003eBecause antibodies against carbohydrate antigens are often autoreactive with their own carbohydrates, the differentiation of B cells to B2 cells can lead to an autoimmune reaction. Therefore, B cells against carbohydrate antigens are carefully regulated by the immune system. Antibodies to native carbohydrates are associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, myocarditis and rheumatic heart disease, Sydenham's chorea, and children's autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS).\u003cbr\u003eUnlike antibodies produced by B2 cells, antibodies produced by B1 and MZB cells are short-lived and [low-affinity==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)], and conducted to an autoimmune reaction with\u003cbr\u003eAutism has an increased level of antibodies to nervous structures and an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain, which indicates that autoimmune and neuroinflammatory processes can play a role in some cases of autism.\u003cbr\u003eBecause [myelinization==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin] (the formation of an insulating nerve fibers) is most intense during the first 9 months of life, and continues in early childhood, neuronal development in infants and young children can be particularly vulnerable to self-reactive antibodies, including those that react with glycoproteins in myelin sheaths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first conjugate vaccine (from Hib) appeared in the US in 1988, and was later licensed in most other developed countries, including Denmark in 1993, and Izr ail, where it was licensed in 1992, and introduced into the national vaccination calendar in 1994.\u003cbr\u003eThe incidence of autism began to rise dramatically in the US since births in the middle of 1987. In Denmark and Israel, the jump in autism began about 5 years later.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1990, the vaccine was licensed to infants from the age of two months, which may explain the further increase in autism.Another explanation for the increase in autism in the mid-90s could be a change in the protein carrier used in the vaccine, which made her more immune gene. If the Hib vaccine is an autism trigger, then an increase in its immunogenicity and a change in the [binding site==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site] may increase the likelihood of autism.\u003cbr\u003eThe licensing of the pneumococcal vaccine in 2000 may partially explain the further increase in autism. Children born in 1995 were the first to be vaccinated against pneumococcus, and this is consistent with CDC data, according to which the level of autism in 1992-1994 did not change, and in 1998 autism was already 57% higher than in 1994, m.\u003cbr\u003eIn Denmark, the Hib vaccine was licensed in 1993, but immediately followed by an aggressive vaccination campaign for children, starting in 1988, which coincides with the growth of autism among those born in 1988 and later. \u003e In Israel, the number of children receiving disability benefits due to autism did not change from 1972 to 1995. But from 1996 to 1998, their number increased 5-fold, which is explained by this hypothesis. In 2004, 11% of the beneficiaries were born in 1985-89 (before vaccine licensing), 21.1% were born in 1990-94 (the beginning of vaccination), and 37% were born in 1995-99 (immediately after the vaccination was introduced National calendar). The immune system in response to the carbohydrate membrane of capsular bacteria produces antibodies through B1 and MZB cells in adults, and in children older than 5 years. But children under 5 years of age react poorly to carbohydrate antigens. Conjugated vaccines consist of a protein carrier attached to a carbohydrate antigen, and are able to circumvent this restriction of the immune system to carbohydrate antigens in children. Due to the protein carrier, these vaccines can induce the production of antibodies by B2 cells.\u003cbr\u003e The development of antibodies to carbohydrate antigens via B2 cells is a significant departure from the natural paradigm in which B1 and MZB cells usually produce short-lived antibodies against carbohydrate antigens, and B2 cells produce more long-living against protein antigens. In addition to the fact that the immune system of children under 5 years of age reacts poorly to capsular bacteria, the maternal IgM and IgG2 antibodies do not pass well the placenta, from which it follows that the embryos are probably also not protected from capsular bacteria. From the point of view of evolution, this is quite unexpected. It is possible that this evolutionary flaw is accompanied by a compensatory evolutionary advantage. One possible explanation is that antibodies to carbohydrate antigens can be cross-reactive with neuronal glycoproteins, and a fine balance has been achieved, by evolution, between evolutionary protection against capsular bacteria and the need for development of the nervous system. This is consistent with the fact that myelination begins with infancy, and lasts until early childhood, which coincides with the period during which the immune system is hypo-sensitive to carbohydrate antigens. Moreover, the period during which the immune system is least sensitive to carbohydrate antigens corresponds to the period of the most intense myelination. It is possible that antibodies to carbohydrates not only interfere with the development of the nervous system in infants and young children, but their negative effects are strengthened by a stable a response of the immune system induced by conjugated vaccines, which significantly disturbs the balance achieved by evolution."}],"editdate":{"$date":"2019-04-28T18:16:09.628Z"},"translated":0,"interpreter":"","interpreter_link":"","I_S_namespace":"Vaccination"}

From this point of view, it seems that the lack of vaccines for all 315 million citizen The United States borders on the unethical, yet people across the country are being vaccinated against influenza, especially in medical institutions, precisely because not everyone wants it, and coercion is the only way to achieve high vaccination coverage. In the 1960s CDC recommended the vaccine only for the elderly (65 and older), in 1984, medical personnel were also inoculated, and in 1987, those who lived in the same house with the elderly were added. In 1997, they began to vaccinate pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. In 2000, they began to vaccinate those who are over 50. In 2004, they began to vaccinate pregnant women in the first trimester, children from 6 months to two years, as well as all those who contact them. In 2006, the recommendation extended to children under 5 years old, and all who contact them.

If influenza is only responsible for 5% of winter mortality, then the vaccine against it can not prevent half of all deaths. If observational studies are impossible to believe, what evidence is there for reducing mortality among the elderly due to vaccination? Practically none. There was only one randomized study among the elderly, it was 20 years ago, and it did not show a decrease in mortality. That is, a flu vaccine is recommended despite a complete lack of clinical trials proving its effectiveness. The recommendation is based only on the development of antibodies, but there is no evidence that these antibodies lead to a reduction in morbidity.

In 1989, 14% of children with paralytic poliomyelitis were vaccinated as at least three doses, and their number increased to 22% in 1994. In Rajasthan, the number of children with paralytic poliomyelitis after six or more doses of the vaccine was 25% in 1999, and 58% in 2000.\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003ci \u003e High incidence of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis.\u003c/i\u003eIt is believed that h about VAPP usually occurs only after the first vaccine dose. However, in 1999, out of 181 cases of VAPP in only nine cases, it occurred after the first dose of the vaccine, 51 paralysis came from subsequent doses, and the remaining 121 only contacted with grafted.\u003cbr\u003e3) \u003ci\u003e Resistance to vaccination.\u003c/i\u003eSome parents believe that the vaccine leads to infertility. These fears are unscientific and ignorant. In addition, children receive countless doses of vaccine, and parents begin to doubt its effectiveness, and also, do the authorities know how many doses are needed for protection.\u003cbr\u003eDuring the massive vaccination campaigns, very sick children are vaccinated as well. And when such a child dies, parents mistakenly believe that he died because of the vaccine, and this has a negative impact on the vaccination campaign.\u003cbr\u003eParents are aware of two facts: a) many children get poliomyelitis despite multiple doses of the vaccine, b) some children (4) Inaccessibility of inactivated vaccine. Although IPV is more expensive (OPV costs 10 cents, and IPV costs 10 dollars), many children became ill with polio, although more than 10 were immunized. times, so the issue of price becomes irrelevant. Moreover, children are given 5 doses of DTP, and they are going to inject the vaccine against hepatitis B, and no one is embarrassed by their high cost.\u003cbr\u003eIn the pre-vaccination era, paralytic poliomyelitis was mainly affected by children from wealthy families, possibly due to increased hygiene. Today they are sick mainly from children from poor families. If the rich really got sick because of hygiene, then in the future outbreaks, rich children will again become victims of paralytic poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis can not be eradicated by the program used today, because the vaccine is ineffective, and in itself leads to paralysis.

But is this really so? To answer this question it is necessary to find out:\u003cbr\u003ea) how many cases of poliomyelitis have been prevented due to vaccination? This question can not be answered. Of course, the number of cases of poliomyelitis in India fell from 13-38 thousand in the 80s, to 1,126 in 1999. However, this was mainly due to a change in the definition of the disease. Before 1990, every case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) was classified as polio, and then only cases caused by poliovirus were considered. In 1996 and in 1999, the definition of poliomyelitis changed again. However, the number of AFP cases over the years has not changed. Moreover, today the number of cases of poliomyelitis is understated, since far from always available stool analyzes. And cases of VAPP are not considered polio at all. In addition, many of them are erroneously classified as other diseases.\u003cbr\u003eb) how many cases of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred despite adequate vaccination? In 1998-2003, 33-60% of all cases of paralysis were inoculated with four or more doses of the vaccine. C) How many cases of paralysis were caused by the vaccine? In the same years, there were 120-206 cases per year, but according to some estimates, they are about 300 per year.\u003cbr\u003eEven if the benefit of eradicating the virus outweighs the concealment of information about the dangers of the vaccine, at least compensate parents if their children fall ill with VAPP , or if they become disabled, or die from polio despite being fully vaccinated.","title":"Some ethical issues arising from polio eradication programs in India.","info_geo":["India"],"info_authors":"Paul","info_date":"2005","infoID":"16222855"},{"info_place":"Science","num":40.0,"info_authors":"Grassly","info_date":"2006","title":"New strategies for the elimination of polio from India.","link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17110580","info_geo":["India"],"info_type":"article","digest":"In the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, children under the age of five received an average of 15 doses of vaccine.

They claimed that Merck manipulated the results of the mumps vaccine clinical trial, which allowed the company to remain the exclusive MMR manufacturer in the United States.\u003cbr\u003eThe [lawsuit==http://www.rescuepost.com/files/june-mumps-suit-1.pdf] states that Merck organized a fictitious vaccine-testing program in the late 90s. The company obliged the scientists to participate in the program, promising them all bonuses if the vaccine got certified, and threatening prison if they were to report this fraud to the FDA. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe effectiveness of the mumps vaccine is determined in the following way. A blood sample is taken from children before and after vaccination. After that, a virus is added to the blood, which creates plaques as it infects the cells. Comparing the amount of these plagues in the blood before and after vaccination indicates the effectiveness of the vaccine. \u003cbr\u003eInstead of testing how children’s blood neutralizes the wild virus strain, Merck was testing how it neutralizes the vaccine strain. However, this was still not enough to demonstrate the required 95% effectiveness. Thus, rabbit antibodies were added to the tested children’s blood, bringing the effectiveness level to 100%.\u003cbr\u003eAnd that is not all of it. Since adding animal antibodies showed pre-vaccine effectiveness of 80% (instead of 10%), the fraud was evident. First, the number of added rabbit antibodies was changed, but it did not give the desired results. So they simply began to falsify the plaque counting, and counted plaques that actually were not in the blood. Falsified data was entered into an Excel file, since changing paper forms took too much time, plus this tactic did not leave any traces of falsification.  \u003cbr\u003eStill, the virologists did contact the FDA and the FDA sent an agent for a check. She asked questions for half an hour, received false answers, did not ask any questions the virologists themselves, did not check the lab, and wrote a one-page report, pointing to some minor issues with the process, but never mentioning neither the rabbit antibodies nor the falsified data.\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, Merck has received the MMR and MMRV certification, and is the sole manufacturer of these vaccines in the United States.\u003cbr\u003eAfter the big mumps outbreaks in 2006 and 2009, the CDC, which planned on eliminating mumps by 2010, shifted the goal date to 2020.\u003cbr\u003eWhen the court asked Merck to provide evidence of the vaccine effectiveness, they provided [data==https://www.reuters.com/article/health-vaccine/merck-accused-of-stonewalling-in-mumps-vaccine-antitrust-lawsuit-idUSL1N0YQ0W820150604] from 50 years ago.","I_S_codenames":["MMRV","MMR"]},{"header":"Safety","num":18.0,"digest":"All MMR safety studies described in the section about measles are applicable to mumps as well.

Cells, in which the virus is grown, need to multiply. To do so, they need a nutrient medium with hormones, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, etc. Fetal bovine serum is usually used as this medium. Since the serum should preferably be sterile, the blood of calves' fetuses is used instead of the cow’s blood.\u003cbr\u003eA pregnant cow is killed and the uterus is removed. Then the fetus is removed from the uterus, the umbilical cord is cut and disinfected. After that the heart is punctured with a needle and the blood is pumped out. Sometimes a pump is used for this, sometimes a massage. After the blood coagulates, platelets and coagulation factors are separated from it by centrifugation. Fetal bovine serum is what remains as a result.\u003cbr\u003eApart form the necessary components, the serum can also contain viruses, bacteria, yeast, fungi, mycoplasmas, endotoxins, and possibly [prions==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion]. Many components of bovine serum have not yet been identified, and the function of many of the identified ones is unknown.\u003cbr\u003e150 ml of serum can be collected from a three months old fetus, 350 ml from a six month old, and 550 ml from a nine month old fetus. (Cows’ pregnancy lasts 9 months). The global market for bovine serum is 500,000 liters every year, which requires approximately 2 million pregnant cows. (Currently, the serum market is [already==https://www.invitria.com/cell-culture-products-types/serum/] 700,000 liters).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe authors then go on to analyze the literature on the subject of whether the fetus suffers when its heart is punctured and its blood is pumped out.\u003cbr\u003eSince the fetus experiences [anoxia==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoxia] (an acute oxygen deficiency) when separated from the placenta, perhaps it could prevent the pain signals from reaching the brain, and the fetus might not suffer. However, it turns out that, unlike adult rabbits, who die of anoxia within 1.5 minutes, prematurely born rabbits can live without oxygen for 44 minutes. This happens because fetuses and newborns compensate for oxygen deficiency with anaerobic metabolism. Moreover, fetal brain consumes much less oxygen than adult brain. Other species of animals show similar results, but calves have never been examined specifically.\u003cbr\u003eScience has only recently raised the issue of whether a mammal’s fetus or newborn feels pain. Just ten years ago, infants were believed to be less sensitive to pain than adults, which is why surgeries on premature and full-term infants were performed without anesthesia. Today, it is believed that human fetus can feel pain as early as 24th week of pregnancy, and can suffer starting from week 11 after conception.  Moreover, fetuses and newborns are more sensitive to pain than adults, since they have not yet [developed==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception] a mechanism for suppressing physiological pain. Therefore, a fetus can even feel pain form a simple touch.\u003cbr\u003eThe authors conclude that normal brain activity is observed in fetus when its heart is being punctured, it feels pain and suffers when the blood is pumped out, and maybe even after the procedure, until it dies.\u003cbr\u003eThe authors then discuss whether it is possible to anesthetize the fetus, so that it would not feel pain. Some believe that anoxia itself plays a role of anesthetic, but that is not the case. In addition, newborn mammals have poor capacity to metabolize drugs. Also, it is undesirable to have these drugs in the serum. Electrical stunning cannot be used either, since it causes cardiac arrest. The authors believe that, perhaps, a bolt, appropriately stunned into the brain, would induce brain death.  \u003cbr\u003eSome manufacturers claim that they kill the fetus before harvesting blood, but that is not true, since the blood clots right after death, and to collect it the fetus must be alive. \u003cbr\u003eThe authors conclude that the procedure of harvesting the fetal bovine serum is inhumane.","info_authors":"Jochems","I_S_codenames":["MMR","fetal_bovine_serum"]},{"info_type":"article","info_place":"Dev Biol Stand","I_S_codenames":["MMR","fetal_bovine_serum"],"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10404869","digest":"20-50% of fetal bovine serum is infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus, as well as other viruses. \u003cbr\u003eWe are talking only about the viruses known to science, which constitute only [a small fraction==https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111005172651.htm] of all the existing viruses.","num":36.0,"title":"Benefits and expenses due to animal serum used in cell culture production.","info_authors":"Wessman","info_date":"1999","infoID":"10404869"},{"info_type":"article","num":37.0,"link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31175","I_S_codenames":["MMR","fetal_bovine_serum"],"info_date":"2016","title":"Fetal Bovine Serum RNA Interferes with the Cell Culture derived Extracellular RNA.","info_place":"Sci Rep","info_authors":"Wei","digest":"Fetal bovine serum contains extracellular RNA, which is impossible to separate from the serum.

In 1963, it became apparent that there was no correlation between the results in mice and the number of neurological consequences in children.\u003cbr\u003e- In addition to the pertussis toxin (an exotoxin – a toxin that is secreted by a living bacterium), the vaccine component itself contains an endotoxin (a toxin released from a bacterium only after its decay). This endotoxin, whose presence was carefully concealed by the vaccine manufacturers, is in fact, very toxic.\u003cbr\u003e- In an article from 1953, it was stated that practically every vaccinated child suffered systemic intoxication, with often permanent CNS lesions.\u003cbr\u003e- The first acellular vaccine appeared in 1937. While it was widely used in the 1940s, it was later discontinued as the company did not want to invest in clinical trials. In the 1960s and 1970s, other acellular vaccines were widely used, but also got withdrawn from production due to their higher costs.\u003cbr\u003e- After two babies died from vaccination in Japan, the Japanese developed the acellular vaccine that has been used since 1981.\u003cbr\u003e- Sweden banned the whole-cell vaccine in the late 1970s. From 1970 to 1985, no child died of pertussis.\u003cbr\u003e- In Tennessee in 1979, four children died after being vaccinated with the same lot of the pertussis vaccine. At this point, the CDC discovered that the vaccine was associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). While the director of the vaccine department of the FDA was on vacation, the FDA decided to withdraw the entire lot from circulation. However, when the director returned, he ordered that the whole lot be returned for distribution, apologizing to the pharmaceutical companies and promising them that it would not happen again. After this incident, manufacturers stopped sending entire lots to the same place, and instead, began distributing each lot throughout the country.\u003cbr\u003e- This paper is also about how the pertussis vaccine led to the approval of a law for compensating victims of vaccinations. It also mentions how the Department of Health does everything possible to not compensate the injured, how almost all vaccine experts have a conflict of interest, and how the experts of committees investigating vaccine side effects are selected, and much more. The United States switched to the safer, acellular vaccine in 2001, 60 years after it was developed, and 20 years after Japan started using it.

Let´s consider leprosy, a disease for which there is no vaccine. Leprosy, roughly speaking, can be of two kinds - tuberculoid or lepromatous. Tuberculoid leprosy is a relatively mild form of the disease in which only the skin is affected, and can often pass without treatment. Lepromatous leprosy, on the other hand, is more severe. In the kind of the disease, all mucous membranes become affected, and the outcome is often lethal. Intermediate forms between these two kinds of the disease are also possible.\u003cbr\u003eWhat determines whether a person will develop tuberculoid leprosy or lepromatous leprosy? The answer to this question is straight forward: the reaction of the individual´s immune system in response to the bacterium.\u003cbr\u003eThe immune system is divided into two subsystems: cellular immunity and humoral immunity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eHumoral immunity\u003c/b\u003e is the immunity mediated by antibodies and other molecules. In response to antigens, B cells produce antibodies that are able to cling to pathogens and either neutralize them or signal to other cells to destroy them. \u003cb\u003eTh2\u003c/b\u003e cells are responsible for this system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eCellular immunity\u003c/b\u003e is an immune response mediated by cells such as phagocytes, CD8 T-cells and others. These cells recognize infected cells and either devour them or kill them. In this system, \u003cb\u003eTh1\u003c/b\u003e cells are responsible.\u003cbr\u003eThese systems suppress one another by producing signalling molecules called cytokines. In other words, the cytokines secreted by Th1 cells suppress Th2 cells, and vice versa.\u003cbr\u003eIn the case of leprosy, if the immune response shifts towards cellular immunity then the disease is more easily controlled, but if the immune response shifts towards humoral immunity, then the disease can take a heavy turn. In this case, cellular immunity (Th1) is therefore much more effective than humoral immunity (Th2) at controlling the disease. Humoral immunity actually interferes with the ability of cellular immunity to perform its task."},{"info_type":"article","info_place":"Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol.","num":23.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28289059","info_date":"2017","title":"What Is Wrong with Pertussis Vaccine Immunity?

The second time the same or a similar pathogen is encountered, the immune system uses the same immune response, even if another (new) response would have been more effective. This phenomenon is called \"[original antigenic sin==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin]\". In the case of whooping cough, after the pertussis bacterium settles in the airways, one of the toxins that it secretes, namely adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), deceives the immune system so that it doesn´t recognise pertussis as a pathogen. After two weeks, however, the immune system realizes that it was deceived, and begins to fight against the pertussis infection. The next time the immune system will come across ACT, it will not be deceived and will immediately suppress the pathogen. Thus, an individual will not become infected a second time. However, since there is no ACT in the vaccine, the immune system of the vaccinated individual does not yet know how to react to it, and the vaccinated individual becomes infected with whooping cough. Now, as a result of original antigenic sin, the immune system in this case will never learn how to respond effectively to pertussis.\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, the more doses an individual receives, the greater the effect of original antigenic sin. This is because with each dose, the immune system will produce more and more specific B-cells. These cells end up competing with naive B-cells that could have adapted and responded more efficiently to a slightly altered pathogen.\u003cbr\u003eThus, since the vaccine pathogen and the natural pathogen differ from each other, the immune response to the real pertussis bacterium in an unvaccinated individual will be much more effective than the immune response in a vaccinated individual.

However, since the number of CIN 1 cases is much higher compared to the CIN 2-3 cases, summing up CIN 1 with CIN 2-3 completely distorts the statistics. \u003cbr\u003e- The authors further analyze clinical trials of the Cervarix vaccine, with similar conclusions. \u003cbr\u003e- After 7 years, the effectiveness of Cervarix in preventing CIN 2 was only 40.6%, with the confidence interval (-106.0 to 84.7) (no statistical significance). \u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eSafety:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- From 2006 to 2012 more than 20,000 cases of adverse events of this vaccine have been reported in the USA, 8% of them were serious ones. 73 people died, 581 became disabled. Since the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is passive, it records only 1% to 10% of all cases, according to various estimates. Therefore, the real amount of adverse events is 10-100 times higher. \u003cbr\u003e- Out of all vaccine adverse events in girls aged 6-29 years, 65% of all serious adverse events are due to HPV vaccine. \u003cbr\u003e- 82% of disability cases of women under 30 are associated with HPV vaccine. \u003cbr\u003e- In Australia the amount of serious adverse events increased to 85% and due to HPV vaccination. The same is happening is other countries as well. \u003cbr\u003e-  In the Cervarix study, which included 9,000 women, 8% had serious adverse event, 32% had significant adverse event, 9% had a spontaneous abortion, 3% got a new chronic disease.

The authors do not report it, nor do they correct this anomaly. \u003cbr\u003e- Diagnostic criteria for ASD changed in 1994 (during the transition from ICD-8 to ICD-10). This could cause a 25-fold increase in the number of ASD cases. \u003cbr\u003e- The 2001 data, which showed a decline in the autism rate since 1991, was included in the first version of the article, which was submitted to JAMA. JAMA rejected the article and the authors submitted it to the Pediatrics. One of the reviewers at Pediatrics noticed that the authors do no analyze the decrease in the autism incidence, which could point to the possibility that removal of thiomersal could have played a role in it. In response to this, the authors removed the 2001 data from the article and it got published. If the authors had not removed this data, the results of the study would have been consistent with the results of a more recent study, according to which, the autism incidence in Denmark after 1992 decreased from the peak 1.5% in 1994 to 1% in 2002-4. \u003cbr\u003e2) \u003cb\u003eStehr-Green, 2003.\u003c/b\u003e Conducted in response to a California study, which discovered a correlation between thiomersal and autism. The authors compared the data from 3 countries (Denmark, Sweden and California). Danish data was the same as in the previous study. Swedish data was based only on inpatient cases (that is, on just a small fraction of all ASD cases). Part of the data from California was excluded from the final publication. \u003cbr\u003e3) \u003cb\u003eHviid, 2003.\u003c/b\u003e The authors state that the mean age of autism diagnosis is 4.7 years, but nonetheless, they included 1-year-olds in the analysis. Moreover, rather than counting the number of children, they counted the number of person-years. Thanks to this technique, each group was considered equally, despite the fact that the probability of diagnosis in younger age groups was much lower. \u003cbr\u003e4) \u003cb\u003eAndwers, 2004.\u003c/b\u003e A retrospective study in the United Kingdom.

However, the first phase of this study, released in an internal presentation, showed that infants who received more than 25 μg of mercury in vaccines and immunoglobulin at the age of one month, had 7.6-fold higher risk of autism, as compared to those who did not receive any mercury. The second phase of the study showed that infants, who received 62.5 μg of mercury before the age of three months, had 2.5-fold higher risk of autism, as compared to those who received less than 37.5 μg. In the third phase, after playing around with statistics, the risk of autism decreased to 1.69. Apparently, the author had been under pressure, since he wrote in an internal CDC correspondence: “I do not wish to be the advocate of the anti-vaccine lobby and sound like being convinced that thimerosal is or was harmful, but at least I feel we should use sound scientific argumentation and not let our standards be dictated by our desire to disprove an unpleasant theory.”\u003cbr\u003eThe fourth and fifth phases of the study were based on partial data only and included children at the age of 0-3 years old, even though the average age for autism diagnosis at the time was 4.4 years.

Moreover, since all the existing epidemiological studies are focused only on MMR or thiomersal, they would not be able to identify an association even theoretically, if we were to assume that other components or vaccines might cause autism as well. The assumption that only MMR can cause autism, and other vaccines cannot, is similar to an assumption that only Marlboro can cause lung cancer, and other brands of cigarettes cannot. Epidemiological studies of acrodynia, most likely, could not have detected this disease, firstly, due to the low susceptibility to it, and secondly, because mercury was widely used at the time. These studies certainly could not have revealed a connection if the scientists had suggested that acrodynia was caused only by tooth powders, and had not considered that acrodynia could also be caused by diapers, mercury anthelmintic chocolates, or broken thermometers. If a disease similar to acrodynia were to appear today, no one would have banned mercury on the basis of the data available by 1953. The evidence based on a series of 28 children and other anecdotal cases, would have been regarded by the scientific community as laughable, and mercury would have kept killing children susceptible to it for many more decades, while the scientific community would have spent billions of dollars testing for genetic causes of acrodynia (and, of course, finding them), and would have conducted large epidemiological studies, the design of which is generally not able to identify mercury as the reason for such disease. \u003cbr\u003eThis is exactly what has been happening with autism since the 90s. \u003cbr\u003eTo date, there is much more scientific evidence on the association between vaccination and ASD, than there was in 1953 on the association between mercury and acrodynia."},{"num":52.0,"digest":"Studies that are most often cited as proof that vaccines do not cause autism: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e[Madsen, 2002:==https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12421889] \u003c/b\u003eMadsen,2002: A Danish study, according to which, those vaccinated with MMR had a 17% lower risk of autism than those unvaccinated.

He coined the new word “allergy” to mean the following: the first contact of immune system with an antigen changes its reactivity, and with repeated and subsequent contacts, this change (or allergy) can cause a spectrum of reactions, from protective (immune) to hypersensitive. At first, the scientific community did not understand this concept, as it undermined the idea of protective nature of the immune response. Nonetheless, the clinical data of the coming years led to the acceptance of this notion, but not the new word. The original meaning of the “allergy” neologism has become perverted, and limited to only describing the states of hypersensitivity. Perhaps, it is due to this distortion that the term “allergy” does not have a clear meaning among the medical professionals today.

It seems that science was unable to explain, overcome and resolve the fears associated with vaccination that arose more than two hundred years ago. \u003cbr\u003eThe term molecular mimicry was borrowed from natural sciences. Mimicry explained how an insect avoids being eaten, reminding the enemy of something they usually do not eat. Raymond Damian transferred this concept to molecular immunological context in 1960. He suggested that parasites avoid immune response due to the similarity of their antigens to host antigens. That is, the term molecular mimicry initially indicated the phenomenon of camouflage in order to avoid recognition. \u003cbr\u003eIn 1962, however, other researchers suggested that infections could cause autoimmune diseases due to the formation of cross-reactive antibodies. According to the new interpretation of the concept of molecular mimicry, the immune system recognizes and attacks pathogen structures, not paying attention to the fact that the host has similar structures, which causes autoimmune disease. However, after three decades of intensive research in this area, a causal relationship between molecular mimicry and autoimmune disease still has not been proven. \u003cbr\u003eIn recent years, it has been found that most viral and bacterial peptides are also found in human [proteome==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteome] (a set of body proteins). Only less than 10% of viral pentapeptides are unique to viruses, and only 0.3% of bacterial hexapeptides are unique to bacteria, and are not found in the human proteome. \u003cbr\u003e(Pentapepdite/hexapeptide is a chain of five/six amino acids. 5-6 amino acids is the minimum length of an antigen). That is, only a tiny part of approximately 30,000 proteins, which form the human proteome do not contain bacterial hexapeptides.\u003cbr\u003eThis massive similarity between viral and bacterial peptides and human peptides, points to the fragility of the molecular mimicry hypothesis, and proves Damian’s suggestion, according to which, the parasite antigens do not trigger an immune response due to the similarity with the host peptides. If the molecular mimicry hypothesis were true, 100% of people would be suffering from autoimmune diseases. Almost all epitopes (part of the antigen that is recognized by the immune system) are located in areas with low antigen similarity. Immunological information is packaged in rare peptides. Therefore, vaccination, which induces an immune response to whole viral or bacterial antigens, can cause a wide range of immune responses. \u003cbr\u003eThe similarity of infectious peptides to human ones can also explain why vaccines based on infectious antigens can trigger a weak immune response, or not trigger one at all. This meager vaccine immunogenicity has necessitated the use of adjuvants. \u003cbr\u003eHowever, the adjuvant-induced hyperactivation of the immune system can alter the tolerogenic mechanism that keeps the immune system under control and prevents harmful autoimmune reactions. Therefore, after the adjuvant vaccination, because of the massive similarity of microbe and human peptides, specific reactions can begin against the molecules or organs of the vaccine recipient, thus triggering autoimmune processes. The type of autoimmune disease will depend on the affected molecules or organs. For example, a reaction to myelin and its associated structures can cause demyelinating diseases, while an immune response against proteins and antigens that influence behavior or cognition can cause ASD or behavioral disorders. \u003cbr\u003eTo summarize: peptide similarity, microbe evasion of the immune system, low vaccine efficacy, the use of adjuvants and autoimmune cross-reaction can form a vicious cycle leading to autoimmunity post vaccination.
