This is because Calmette and Guerin, who named the vaccine, developed it initially for cattle, and not for humans. To this day, it is not known how important it is that the vaccine is based on M. bovis, and not on M. tuberculosis.\u003cbr\u003eCalmette added bile to the culture of bacteria, so that they do not They fell and noticed that after a few months the bacterium became less virulent for guinea pigs. He continued to attenuate the bacterium in the presence of bile for 13 years, changing the nutrient medium every two weeks.\u003cbr\u003eSince 1921, BCG has also begun to be done to humans. But since at that time the bacteria could not be freeze dry, they continued to be weakened in the same way and continued until 1961, changing the substrate every two weeks.\u003cbr\u003eCalmette reported a decrease in virulence after 15 passages, and an even larger weakening after 215 passages. Was the bacterium weakened even more by 1961, after 1,173 passages, is unknown, since neither the original bacteria nor the original BCG of 1921 have survived.\u003cbr\u003eSince 1924, BCG have begun to spread to laboratories in other countries that have continued to weaken the bacteria by that the same scheme and with the same goal - to prevent the return of virulence, while maintaining efficiency. So in different countries, BCG daughter strains were formed, which are called at the place of the laboratory (BCG Russia, Tokyo, Denmark, etc.). At present, BCG strains are prepared from lyophilized bacterial stocks that are re-suspended (added back to water) before vaccination. In most BCG vaccines, 90-95% of bacteria are dead, but in BCG Tokyo, 25% of bacteria are live. The importance of the proportion of live bacteria in the vaccine has not yet been studied. For example, do dead bacteria compensate the living? Science does not yet know the answer to this question.\u003cbr\u003eWhat is important for a weakened vaccine is the presence of antigens in the absence of virulence. But it is known that certain strains of BCG lost antigens compared to the original bacterium. Loss of antigens is obviously undesirable, and it should be studied.\u003cbr\u003eIn an experiment in Czechoslovakia, the BCG-Prague strain was changed to BCG-Russia. The incidence of disseminated tuberculosis, including BCG osteitis due to vaccination, was higher in the Russian strain.\u003cbr\u003eIn the 1970s there was an epidemic of BCG osteitis in Sweden and in Finland, after which Finland switched to another strain, and Sweden canceled vaccination.\u003cbr\u003eHave the strains of BCG changed during this time? Certainly. Is it important? Watching who to ask. The bacteriologist will be surprised if BCG has not changed significantly over half a century of cultivation in the laboratory. An official planning to vaccinate millions of babies needs more information. Is there the most effective strain of BCG? Or is it the safest? Do they differ? The answers to these questions, unfortunately, are still unknown.\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether a certain strain of BCG will be used in the future, its genetically modified version, or an entirely new vaccine, let's hope that manufacturers will conduct clinical trials of the vaccine so that we again did not remain with the uncertainty of vaccinating millions of babies every year, without a clear understanding of its risks and benefits.","title":"BCG - different strains, different vaccines?","info_place":"Lancet Infect Dis","info_date":"2002","infoID":"11901655"},{"info_authors":"Lawn","info_place":"Lancet","num":2.0,"link":"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)62173-3/abstract","digest":"4 billion people have been vaccinated with BCG since 1921.

The health prospects of one group of people are increasing due to the health damage of another group. Despite the fact that the program of mass vaccination from chickenpox was started in several countries, while other countries are waiting for the final results of studies of the effect of exogenous boosting, an attempt at an ethical analysis of vaccination before The question of vaccination can not be resolved through simple ethical rules such as respecting autonomy (graft) or \"do not harm others\" (not being vaccinated). requires a balance between the competing interests of different groups and therefore requires a more complex ethical approach.\u003cbr\u003eAuthors view this ethical issue through two fundamental ethical approaches: classical utilitarianism and contractualism. The utilitarian approach is based on two prerequisites Kah: (1) the effect of selection on the well-being (happiness or health) is the only aspect really having a value, and (2) well-being of each equally important. That is, what is important in choosing alternatives is an increase in the average level of well-being.\u003cbr\u003eIn the case of chickenpox, thus, the question is whether vaccination will reduce the overall incidence. Despite the fact that empirical evidence from the US indicates a drop in hospitalization due to chickenpox by 88%, and a 74% reduction in mortality, these data do not take into account the influence on the elderly. If we take it into account, then vaccination becomes already unattractive, since it is estimated that an increase in the incidence of shingles will exceed the decrease in the incidence of chickenpox.\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, according to classical utilitarianism, mass vaccination is undesirable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the point of view of contractualism, an ethical decision is determined not consequences, but an excuse in terms of the principles and rules arising from the hypothetical \"social contract\". This agreement is concluded between all people and it determines which fundamental rules should govern the society. That is, unlike the utilitarian approach, what is important is not the quantitative benefit of vaccination, but whether its introduction can be justified from the point of view of generally accepted principles. Principles that should also be acceptable to those who lose from it - adults and elderly. The following considerations are considered: 1) \u003ci\u003e Freedom\u003c/i\u003e protection of one's health (through vaccination).\u003cbr\u003e2) \u003ci\u003e Responsibility \u003c/i\u003e.

Some elderly people will not be able to protect themselves from shingles (because the vaccine is not effective or contraindicated). These people will be sacrificed for the benefit of a large group of children. However, since the shingles are rarely flying, this sacrifice is perfectly acceptable.\u003cbr\u003e4) \u003ci\u003eUncertainty\u003c/i\u003e. Although exogenous booster exists, its effect on the incidence of shingles is less established than the effect of vaccination on the incidence of chickenpox.

This is due to the fact that B2 cells do not synthesize antibodies without the signal of T-helper cells. In order for this to happen, the B2-cell, and its related T-helper cell, should recognize the same, or similar [epitope==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope]. But since T cells recognize only protein epitopes, T helper cells are usually able to activate B2 cells in response to protein antigens. In response to bacterial capsular polysaccharides, the immune system forms a response through cells B1 and MZB (Marginal zone B). B1 cells do not begin to react to bacterial carbohydrate antigens until 18-24 months, and their response does not fully mature until about 5 years of age. Therefore, infants and young children are unable to respond effectively to capsular bacteria. Conjugated vaccines use the fact that B2 cells and their related T helper cells do not have to respond to an identical epitope, but rather recognize closely related epitopes. Although the mechanisms by which conjugate vaccines work are not fully understood, it is believed that [antigen-presenting cells==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen-presenting_cell], treat the combined protein carrier and carbohydrate [hapten==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapten], which leads to recognition of the protein carrier by T-helper cells, and recognition of carbohydrate antigens by B2 cells. That is, conjugated vaccines change the immunological response to carbohydrate antigens in infants and young children, from a hypo-sensitive to a full T cell response.\u003cbr\u003eBecause antibodies against carbohydrate antigens are often autoreactive with their own carbohydrates, the differentiation of B cells to B2 cells can lead to an autoimmune reaction. Therefore, B cells against carbohydrate antigens are carefully regulated by the immune system. Antibodies to native carbohydrates are associated with several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, myocarditis and rheumatic heart disease, Sydenham's chorea, and children's autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS).\u003cbr\u003eUnlike antibodies produced by B2 cells, antibodies produced by B1 and MZB cells are short-lived and [low-affinity==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)], and conducted to an autoimmune reaction with\u003cbr\u003eAutism has an increased level of antibodies to nervous structures and an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain, which indicates that autoimmune and neuroinflammatory processes can play a role in some cases of autism.\u003cbr\u003eBecause [myelinization==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin] (the formation of an insulating nerve fibers) is most intense during the first 9 months of life, and continues in early childhood, neuronal development in infants and young children can be particularly vulnerable to self-reactive antibodies, including those that react with glycoproteins in myelin sheaths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first conjugate vaccine (from Hib) appeared in the US in 1988, and was later licensed in most other developed countries, including Denmark in 1993, and Izr ail, where it was licensed in 1992, and introduced into the national vaccination calendar in 1994.\u003cbr\u003eThe incidence of autism began to rise dramatically in the US since births in the middle of 1987. In Denmark and Israel, the jump in autism began about 5 years later.\u003cbr\u003eIn 1990, the vaccine was licensed to infants from the age of two months, which may explain the further increase in autism.Another explanation for the increase in autism in the mid-90s could be a change in the protein carrier used in the vaccine, which made her more immune gene. If the Hib vaccine is an autism trigger, then an increase in its immunogenicity and a change in the [binding site==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_site] may increase the likelihood of autism.\u003cbr\u003eThe licensing of the pneumococcal vaccine in 2000 may partially explain the further increase in autism. Children born in 1995 were the first to be vaccinated against pneumococcus, and this is consistent with CDC data, according to which the level of autism in 1992-1994 did not change, and in 1998 autism was already 57% higher than in 1994, m.\u003cbr\u003eIn Denmark, the Hib vaccine was licensed in 1993, but immediately followed by an aggressive vaccination campaign for children, starting in 1988, which coincides with the growth of autism among those born in 1988 and later. \u003e In Israel, the number of children receiving disability benefits due to autism did not change from 1972 to 1995. But from 1996 to 1998, their number increased 5-fold, which is explained by this hypothesis. In 2004, 11% of the beneficiaries were born in 1985-89 (before vaccine licensing), 21.1% were born in 1990-94 (the beginning of vaccination), and 37% were born in 1995-99 (immediately after the vaccination was introduced National calendar). The immune system in response to the carbohydrate membrane of capsular bacteria produces antibodies through B1 and MZB cells in adults, and in children older than 5 years. But children under 5 years of age react poorly to carbohydrate antigens. Conjugated vaccines consist of a protein carrier attached to a carbohydrate antigen, and are able to circumvent this restriction of the immune system to carbohydrate antigens in children. Due to the protein carrier, these vaccines can induce the production of antibodies by B2 cells.\u003cbr\u003e The development of antibodies to carbohydrate antigens via B2 cells is a significant departure from the natural paradigm in which B1 and MZB cells usually produce short-lived antibodies against carbohydrate antigens, and B2 cells produce more long-living against protein antigens. In addition to the fact that the immune system of children under 5 years of age reacts poorly to capsular bacteria, the maternal IgM and IgG2 antibodies do not pass well the placenta, from which it follows that the embryos are probably also not protected from capsular bacteria. From the point of view of evolution, this is quite unexpected. It is possible that this evolutionary flaw is accompanied by a compensatory evolutionary advantage. One possible explanation is that antibodies to carbohydrate antigens can be cross-reactive with neuronal glycoproteins, and a fine balance has been achieved, by evolution, between evolutionary protection against capsular bacteria and the need for development of the nervous system. This is consistent with the fact that myelination begins with infancy, and lasts until early childhood, which coincides with the period during which the immune system is hypo-sensitive to carbohydrate antigens. Moreover, the period during which the immune system is least sensitive to carbohydrate antigens corresponds to the period of the most intense myelination. It is possible that antibodies to carbohydrates not only interfere with the development of the nervous system in infants and young children, but their negative effects are strengthened by a stable a response of the immune system induced by conjugated vaccines, which significantly disturbs the balance achieved by evolution."}],"editdate":{"$date":"2018-10-14T15:51:27.287Z"},"translated":0,"interpreter":"","interpreter_link":"","I_S_namespace":"Vaccination"}

From this point of view, it seems that the lack of vaccines for all 315 million citizen The United States borders on the unethical, yet people across the country are being vaccinated against influenza, especially in medical institutions, precisely because not everyone wants it, and coercion is the only way to achieve high vaccination coverage. In the 1960s CDC recommended the vaccine only for the elderly (65 and older), in 1984, medical personnel were also inoculated, and in 1987, those who lived in the same house with the elderly were added. In 1997, they began to vaccinate pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. In 2000, they began to vaccinate those who are over 50.

If observational studies are impossible to believe, what evidence is there for reducing mortality among the elderly due to vaccination? Practically none. There was only one randomized study among the elderly, it was 20 years ago, and it did not show a decrease in mortality. That is, a flu vaccine is recommended despite a complete lack of clinical trials proving its effectiveness.

And if the amount of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid was increased - it was \"non-paralytic poliomyelitis.\" Today, it is known that such a laboratory diagnosis is typical of viral meningitis, but this by no means indicates poliomyelitis. Only when epidemics have already begun to decline have begun to be checked for availability which led to the overdiagnosis of poliomyelitis during epidemics. Any kind of paralysis - peripheral neuropathy, stroke, cerebral or spinal tumor, multiple sclerosis, hysterical paralysis and many other diseases could be diagnosed as poliomyelitis. After the diagnosis of poliomyelitis was made, from it was difficult to refuse because of generous financial assistance to the victims of poliomyelitis, which was not available to patients with other types of paralysis.\u003cbr\u003eParalysis happened more often in people who were tired of physical activity ty, those who have recently removed tonsils, and those who had recently been vaccinated. In recently vaccinated paralysis usually began at the site of the injection. For the treatment of poliomyelitis, many drugs have been used, including strychnine, curare, cobra venom and various antibiotics. The effectiveness of these drugs was based on anecdotal information, but was offered with confidence. One of the frequent treatments was the irradiation of muscles and the spinal cord. In the 20th century, with acute poliomyelitis, gypsum and [buses==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splint_(medicine)] began to be applied.

Subsequently, it turned out that 40,000 of them became ill with polio, 200 were paralyzed and 10 died, because the vaccine was not sufficiently inactivated and contained a living virus. The Wyeth vaccine also resulted in paralysis and death in some cases. Other companies also had difficulties with inactivating the virus. Too little formaldehyde did not kill the virus, but too much made the vaccine useless.

Over time, this led to an abundance of lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers, which resulted in the adoption of a law in 1986 that it was impossible to sue vaccine manufacturers.

In 1996 and in 1999, the definition of poliomyelitis changed again. However, the number of AFP cases over the years has not changed. Moreover, today the number of cases of poliomyelitis is understated, since far from always available stool analyzes. And cases of VAPP are not considered polio at all. In addition, many of them are erroneously classified as other diseases.\u003cbr\u003eb) how many cases of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred despite adequate vaccination? In 1998-2003, 33-60% of all cases of paralysis were inoculated with four or more doses of the vaccine. C) How many cases of paralysis were caused by the vaccine? In the same years, there were 120-206 cases per year, but according to some estimates, they are about 300 per year.\u003cbr\u003eEven if the benefit of eradicating the virus outweighs the concealment of information about the dangers of the vaccine, at least compensate parents if their children fall ill with VAPP , or if they become disabled, or die from polio despite being fully vaccinated.","title":"Some ethical issues arising from polio eradication programs in India.","info_geo":["India"],"info_authors":"Paul","info_date":"2005","infoID":"16222855"},{"info_place":"Science","num":40.0,"info_authors":"Grassly","info_date":"2006","title":"New strategies for the elimination of polio from India.","link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17110580","info_geo":["India"],"info_type":"article","digest":"In the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, children under the age of five received an average of 15 doses of vaccine.

Cells in which viruses are grown must multiply, and for this they need a nutrient medium with hormones, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins and t As embryonic bovine serum is usually used as this medium. Since the whey should be preferably sterile, it is not the blood of cows but the blood of calf embryos that is used for its production.\u003cbr\u003eThe pregnant cow is killed and the uterus is taken out of it, then the fetus is removed from the uterus, the umbilical cord is cut and disinfected, and then the heart is pierced and the blood is pumped out.Sometimes a pump is used for this, and sometimes a massage, and then the blood is coagulated and centrifuged from it platelets and clotting factors are separated, what remains as a result is fetal bovine serum. In addition to the right ingredients, the serum can also contain viruses, bacteria, yeasts, fungi, mycoplasmas, endotoxins and possibly [prions==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion]. Many components of bovine serum have not yet been determined, and the function of many of those that are determined is unknown.\u003cbr\u003eThree months of the embryo produces 150 ml of serum, of a six-month period 350 ml, and of a nine-month period 550 ml. (Pregnancy of cows lasts 9 months). The world market of bovine serum is 500,000 liters per year, which requires about 2 million pregnant cows. (At the moment, the whey market [is==https://www.invitria.com/cell-culture-products-types/serum/] is already 700,000 liters.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Next, the authors examine the literature on the topic, Does the fetus suffer during piercing the heart and pumping out the blood.\u003cbr\u003eBecause the fetus that is separated from the placenta is experiencing [anoxia==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoxia] (acute lack of oxygen), perhaps this leads to the fact that the pain signals do not reach the brain, and the fetus does not suffer. , it turns out that unlike adult rabbits, which die after 1.5 minutes ano Xenia, prematurely born rabbits live without oxygen for 44 minutes. This is because the embryos and newborns compensate for the lack of oxygen through anaerobic metabolism. In addition, the fetal brain consumes much less oxygen than the adult brain. Among other species of animals, a similar pattern is observed, however, it was the calves that were not examined.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScience has only recently wondered if the mammalian fetus or newborn pain is experiencing. Just ten years ago, it was believed that infants are less sensitive to pain than adults, so the operation of preterm and born infants was done without anesthesia. Today it is believed that the human fetus is experiencing pain from the 24th week, and can suffer from the 11th week after conception. Moreover, embryos and newborns are more sensitive to pain than adults, since they have not yet [developed==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception] Mechanism of suppression of physiological pain. Therefore, the fetus may feel pain even if it is simply touched. The authors conclude that during piercing the heart the fetus has normal brain activity, it experiences pain and suffers when the blood is pumped out of it, and possibly even after the end of this procedure , before dying.\u003cbr\u003eNext, the authors speculate whether it is possible to anesthetize the fetus so that it does not feel pain. Some believe that anoxia itself plays the role of an anesthetic, but it is not. In addition, newborn mammals are very poor at absorbing drugs. And the presence of these drugs in the serum is undesirable. Electroshock also does not fit, as it leads to cardiac arrest. The authors believe that perhaps a bolt that is correctly stuffed into the brain will lead to brain death of the fetus. Some manufacturers claim that they kill the fetus before the blood is extracted from it. But this is not true, because the blood is curtailed immediately after death, and to extract it, the fetus must be alive. The authors conclude that the procedure for collecting embryonic bovine serum is inhumane.","info_authors":"Jochems","I_S_codenames":["MMR","fetal_bovine_serum"]},{"info_type":"article","num":33.0,"link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10404869","I_S_codenames":["MMR","fetal_bovine_serum"],"info_date":"1999","title":"Benefits and expenses due to animal serum used in cell culture production.","info_place":"Dev Biol Stand","info_authors":"Wessman","digest":"20-50% of embryonic bovine serum is infected with the bovine diarrhea virus, as well as other viruses.

The second time the same or a similar pathogen is encountered, the immune system uses the same immune response, even if another (new) response would have been more effective. This phenomenon is called \"[original antigenic sin==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin]\". In the case of whooping cough, after the pertussis bacterium settles in the airways, one of the toxins that it secretes, namely adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), deceives the immune system so that it doesn´t recognise pertussis as a pathogen. After two weeks, however, the immune system realizes that it was deceived, and begins to fight against the pertussis infection. The next time the immune system will come across ACT, it will not be deceived and will immediately suppress the pathogen. Thus, an individual will not become infected a second time. However, since there is no ACT in the vaccine, the immune system of the vaccinated individual does not yet know how to react to it, and the vaccinated individual becomes infected with whooping cough. Now, as a result of original antigenic sin, the immune system in this case will never learn how to respond effectively to pertussis.\u003cbr\u003eMoreover, the more doses an individual receives, the greater the effect of original antigenic sin. This is because with each dose, the immune system will produce more and more specific B-cells. These cells end up competing with naive B-cells that could have adapted and responded more efficiently to a slightly altered pathogen.\u003cbr\u003eThus, since the vaccine pathogen and the natural pathogen differ from each other, the immune response to the real pertussis bacterium in an unvaccinated individual will be much more effective than the immune response in a vaccinated individual.

The article is long, but very informative, and is worth reading in full. \u003cbr\u003e- PAP smear is a test that determines whether one has dysplasia. In developed countries where it is widely used, the risk of death from cervical cancer is very low (1.4/100,000 women). 90% of deaths from cervical cancer are recorded in third world countries. (The risk of disease is also very low – 7/100,000 women. Moreover, the death rate from cervical cancer continues to fall rapidly. In the 90s, without any vaccinations, it decreased by half.) \u003cbr\u003e- An even bigger reduction of mortality from cervical cancer due to vaccinations in the developed countries is highly unlikely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eEffectiveness:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Since the development of cervical cancer takes decades, and pharmaceutical companies do not want to wait so long, surrogate markers (i.e. dysplasia CIN 1-3, which develop faster) are used instead of cancer in vaccine clinical trials. But since the vast majority of these dysplasias pass on their own, they are a pretty bad marker for cervical cancer.\u003cbr\u003e- The test for dysplasia, especially CIN 2, is very imprecise, which also makes it a bad marker. \u003cbr\u003e- Therefore, the effectiveness of a vaccine, determined on the basis of dysplasia, is not an indication of the effectiveness of the vaccine against cervical cancer. \u003cbr\u003e- Analyzing clinical trials, the effectiveness of Gardasil in preventing CIN 2-3, associated with any strain of HPV, was only 14-17%. (This is the actual effectiveness of the vaccine. But even this number is too high, as dysplasia does not always develop into cancer.)\u003cbr\u003e- Effectiveness of the vaccine for those, who have already been infected with HPV, was negative (from -33% to -44%). That is, for those already infected, vaccine increases the risk of dysplasia. These results were not mentioned in the article published my Merck. Nonetheless, FDA does not require testing for the infection before vaccinating.\u003cbr\u003e- Prevention of CIN 1-3 from 16/18 strains was at 100%. The statistical significance of these results, however, is rather doubtful. First of all, the confidence interval is very wide. The vaccine prevented 3 cases of CIN 1-3 in one group, and 7 cases in the other. Second of all, CIN 1 develops into cancer only in 1% of the cases. However, since the number of CIN 1 cases is much higher compared to the CIN 2-3 cases, summing up CIN 1 with CIN 2-3 completely distorts the statistics. \u003cbr\u003e- The authors further analyze clinical trials of the Cervarix vaccine, with similar conclusions. \u003cbr\u003e- After 7 years, the effectiveness of Cervarix in preventing CIN 2 was only 40.6%, with the confidence interval (-106.0 to 84.7) (no statistical significance). \u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003eSafety:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- From 2006 to 2012 more than 20,000 cases of adverse events of this vaccine have been reported in the USA, 8% of them were serious ones. 73 people died, 581 became disabled. Since the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is passive, it records only 1% to 10% of all cases, according to various estimates. Therefore, the real amount of adverse events is 10-100 times higher. \u003cbr\u003e- Out of all vaccine adverse events in girls aged 6-29 years, 65% of all serious adverse events are due to HPV vaccine. \u003cbr\u003e- 82% of disability cases of women under 30 are associated with HPV vaccine. \u003cbr\u003e- In Australia the amount of serious adverse events increased to 85% and due to HPV vaccination. The same is happening is other countries as well. \u003cbr\u003e-  In the Cervarix study, which included 9,000 women, 8% had serious adverse event, 32% had significant adverse event, 9% had a spontaneous abortion, 3% got a new chronic disease.

Тем не менее, охват тремя дозами именно этой вакцины используется в качестве главного индикатора успеха программ вакцинации.

Человеческие ДНК-фрагменты подобной длины спонтанно интегрируются в геном клеточных линий, а при воспалении этот процесс усиливается. Человеческий геном естественным образом содержит области, которые восприимчивы к разрыву двойной нити ДНК и к вставному мутагенезу. Эти участки особенно сконцентрированы в генах, которые ассоциированы с аутизмом. Решение этой ужасающей проблемы легкодоступно: вакцины можно производить на клеточных линиях животных, насекомых или растений, устраняя опасность остаточной ДНК человека и ретровирусных загрязнений.

Среди них называются инфекция, недостаток какого-либо витамина, аллергия, отравление грибком или мышьяком. Упоминается также возможное отравление ртутью (впервые эта гипотеза была [высказана==https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1999251] в 1846-м году, а затем снова в 1922-м). Однако, по мнению автора статьи, акродиния - это форма энцефалопатии, которая вызывается психологическими и эмоциональными факторами.\u003cbr\u003eЛишь в 1953 году было [установлено==https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347653801952], что причиной акродинии является ртуть, и это было сделано на основании исследования серии случаев из 28 детей, то есть на основании точно такого же исследования, которое провел Уэйкфилд. Авторы объясняют, что некоторые лекарства, которые нормально переносятся большинством, могут все-же быть опасными для некоторых людей. Они упоминают ртутные диуретики, тысячи доз которых кололи пациентам без каких-либо видимых побочных эффектов, однако иногда очередная инъекция приводила к внезапной смерти.\u003cbr\u003eВ [статье==https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/501896] 1966 года, посвященной исчезнувшей уже акродинии, сообщается, что эта болезнь представляла собой увлекательную загадку для поколения педиатров. Теория о ртути, как о причине акродинии, была принята медленно, после сопротивления, колебаний и даже насмешек. Лишь после запрета ртути акродиния исчезла, без фанфар и торжеств. В конце статьи, автор, который установил окончательную связь между ртутью и акродинией за 16 лет до этого, задаётся следующим вопросом:\u003cbr\u003e\u0026quot;Действительно ли существует научное доказательство правдивости этой теории? Мы, кто верили в эту теорию уже давно, собрали клочки доказательств, а затем предсказали, что болезнь исчезнет, когда ртуть будет удалена в качестве обычного домашнего средства и медицинской панацеи. И акродиния исчезла. Но является ли это научным доказательством? Ведь столько всего изменилось с 1950-х годов, что может быть мы отдаем должное неверной мере. И верящие в вирусную теорию акродинии могут возразить: эпидемии приходят и уходят, и теперь мы находимся в периоде естественного упадка болезни. Вирусологи иногда используют эту аргументацию в своих обсуждениях. Требуется много лет, чтобы опровергнуть эту теорию, и нет вирусологов, желающих исследовать мертвую болезнь. Таким образом, антимеркуриалисты победили по умолчанию, и мы остаемся с вопросом: что представляет собой научное доказательство?

Аутизм тоже поражает лишь восприимчивых детей, и таких, на сегодняшний день, менее 3%. Даже если предположить, что вакцины могут вызвать аутизм, эпидемиологические исследования, которые не принимают во внимание эту восприимчивость, могут не выявить связь. Более того, поскольку все существующие эпидемиологические исследования сосредотачиваются лишь на MMR или на тиомерсале, они даже теоретически не способны выявить связь, если предположить, что другие компоненты и другие вакцины тоже могут вызывать аутизм. Предположение, что только MMR может вызвать аутизм, а другие вакцины нет, подобно предположению, что только Мальборо может вызвать рак легких, а другие марки сигарет нет. Эпидемиологические исследования акродинии скорее всего неспособны были бы выявить эту болезнь, во-первых, из-за низкой восприимчивости к этой болезни, а во-вторых, потому что ртуть в те времена была широко распространена. Но подобные исследования совершенно точно не могли бы выявить связи, если бы ученые предположили, что акродиниия вызывается лишь зубными порошками, и не рассматривали бы также возможность акродинии от подгузников, ртутных глистогонных шоколадок или разбитых термометров. Если бы подобная акродинии болезнь появилась сегодня, то на основании имеющихся к 1953-му году данных, ртуть бы никто не запрещал, а доказательство, основанное на серии из 28 детей и других анекдотических случаях, было бы расценено научным сообществом как смехотворное, и ртуть еще много десятилетий после этого убивала бы восприимчивых к ней детей, в то время как научное сообщество тратило бы миллиарды долларов на проверку генетических причин акродинии (и, разумеется, находило бы их), и проводило бы большие эпидемиологические исследования, дизайн которых в принципе не способен выявить ртуть, как причину подобной болезни.\u003cbr\u003eЭто именно то, что происходит начиная с 90-х годов с аутизмом.\u003cbr\u003eНа сегодняшний день имеется намного больше научных свидетельств о связи между вакцинацией и аутизмом, чем было в 1953 году о связи между ртутью и акродинией.
