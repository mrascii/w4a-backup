For a long time ago, I do not remember exactly what it was about, but it was something about the fact that they are not allowed to legalize relations. Among other things, it was written that the son of one of them became autistic because of a vaccination. This was reported in one line, after which they continued to discuss lesbian affairs. I was so amazed by this line and the fact that they are discussing such nonsense, instead of discussing the main thing - that the child became autistic after a vaccination, that I then kept this article for a long time, as a reminder that with the subject of vaccinations, you need to thoroughly understand somehow.","points":[{"item":"Over the past few months, I spent hundreds of hours researching vaccination topics. I have fully read over a thousand scientific studies, and many abstracts. Now I can say with all certainty that if you have not deliberately dealt with this topic, then practically everything you know about vaccinations is a lie. From the beginning to the end. All that is written on this topic in the media is propaganda, fake news, and all this has nothing to do with either science or reality.","num":1.0},{"item":"I absolutely do not want to engage in reverse propaganda, because this is a very thankless task, but firstly, I just cannot not write about it, secondly, I write all this to organize my thoughts on this topic, and thirdly, perhaps my excessive investment of time in the study of the theme of vaccinations will help other parents make the right decision.\r\nIf you are absolutely sure that vaccinations are important, safe and effective, and want to stay like that, then please do not read further. Even with a little understanding of this topic, you will not be able to keep this confidence.\r\n","num":2.0},{"item":"Recently I talked to one relative who told me that when he had his first child, he devoted quite a lot of time to choosing a stroller, a cot, a child seat for the car, etc. But he did not spend a minute trying to figure out what vaccinations are worth or not worth doing. Almost all parents delegate the right to this decision to others. They believe that other people - scientists, doctors or nurses have already dealt with this topic, and made the best decision.","num":3.0},{"item":"Parents take a huge number of decisions for their children. What they eat during pregnancy, where they give birth, how and what to feed the child, to feed according to a schedule or on demand, how to introduce solid foods and when, whether to give a pacifier, what babysitter to use, to which kindergarten / school to send it, etc., etc. Parents take hundreds of decisions related to all aspects of the life of the child, with the goal of raising a healthy and happy child.","num":4.0},{"item":"At the moment I believe that the most important parental decision is to vaccinate or not to vaccinate a child. And this most important decision, almost all parents delegate. After all, the most important thing for any parent is the health of the child. And there is practically nothing else that would influence their health more than the decision to vaccinate or not, and if done, which.","num":5.0},{"item":"Some parents with whom I spoke are so confident in the importance of vaccinations that even knowing that some people think that vaccines are unsafe, they just do not want to understand it, but they aggressively defend their point of view without reading a single scientific article. They do not want to listen to a word that some vaccines may not be very effective, or not very safe, though this has been proven by many scientific studies. With them, you can calmly discuss any other topic, but as soon as it comes to vaccinations, they are like a different person. They do not want to listen to any arguments, and almost scream about how important it is to vaccinate children, and what a blessing it has been for humanity, that medicine has given us vaccines.\r\nAt first I could not understand it at all. How can it be that these very clever and educated people become so religious and inadequate as soon as it comes to this purely scientific topic. And then I seem to understand.\r\nThey all have already vaccinated their children, and, like most parents, they took the responsibility for this decision, and then delegated it to others. Subconsciously they understand that if it turns out that vaccinations are not completely harmless, then they endangered health, and perhaps even the lives of their children. It is difficult to realize this. It is much easier to live thinking that a child has already been born that way. With allergies, delayed development, with persistent ear infections, with any autoimmune disease, or even with a bunch of diseases. It is very difficult to live with the knowledge that you gave them this disease. Delegating authority, and disclaiming responsibility for this decision. By zealously defending vaccinations, even without knowing anything about them, these parents protect themselves from powerful cognitive dissonance.\r\nTherefore, if you have already fully vaccinated your children, you are not going to do any new vaccinations, and your grandchildren are still far away, you should probably not be interested in this topic. Although, on the other hand, many consequences of vaccinations are cured if one realizes that they are acquired, rather than congenital.","num":6.0},{"item":"The theme of vaccinations is very extensive. It cannot be understood in a few hours, or even in a few days. It is desirable to devote at least 50-100 hours to it, and even better, more still. On the one hand it's a lot of time, on the other hand, a lot of materials on vaccines are documentaries, series and video lectures. Replacing only a couple of seasons of your favorite TV series with serials, films and lectures on the theme of vaccinations, you will already provide the lion's share of the time needed to research this topic. And this will change your life much more than the regular season of the Game of Thrones.\r\nFor the number of hours that I devoted to the topic of vaccinations, I could learn a couple more foreign languages, or learn how to play the guitar skillfully. But looking back, I can say that the theme of vaccinations is probably the most important topic that I have been interested in life so far. The conclusions that follow from it go far beyond vaccinations, and even beyond the limits of medicine. Vaccine research changed my worldview, like nothing else.\r\n","num":7.0},{"item":"Many parents believe that they basically cannot deal with vaccinations, and put forward two arguments. The first argument is that a biological or medical education is needed to understand this topic.\r\nThis is not true. Vaccinations are not rocket science, and any sane person is able to understand them.\r\nI do not even have close to a biomedical education, but my wife is a doctor, which, of course, very much helped me understand this topic. There are many biological concepts and terms which it is desirable to understand, and when there is someone who can immediately explain what CD4 is, what distinguishes CIN1 from CIN3, or IgG from IgA, it saves a lot of time. On the other hand, Wikipedia also explains all that well. In principle, a complete understanding of all these biological processes is not necessarily necessary to understand whether vaccines are safe or not.\r\nMy wife also taught me a much more important skill - the ability to critically read medical research. It turned out that reading medical research is very different from reading research in the exact sciences. There are many ways to design research, choose a control group and placebo, and play with the data so that you can prove anything.","num":8.0},{"item":"The second argument is that no one can understand this topic better than scientists from the FDA or CDC. And if these scientists claim that vaccinations are completely safe and effective, then any other opinion is, by definition, the opinion of an incompetent person.\r\nFirst, it is an appeal to authority, i.e. a logical error in itself.\r\nSecondly, the question that faces scientists from the CDC, is very different from the question that faces parents. CDC respond to the question \"how to reduce the number of infectious diseases of the population with minimum risk, minimum price, and with maximum efficiency.\" The question that faces parents is how to \"grow a maximally healthy child.\" These are completely different questions, and the answers to them, respectively, may turn out to be completely different.\r\nThird, the interests of scientists, the FDA and the CDC go far beyond the \"health of the population\", and this will be a considerable amount of later material.\r\nFourthly, they do not have skin in the game. Your children's health is of interest only to you. It does not interest any doctors, nurses, pharmaceutical companies, nor, especially, scientists from the CDC. If something happens to your child due to vaccination, none of them will bear any responsibility.","num":9.0},{"item":"The theme of vaccinations is extremely emotional. Many people, for some reason, find it very difficult to rationally study this topic, and even read something on this topic. But in order to understand it, you need to leave emotions aside. It is necessary to admit that perhaps the arguments against vaccination, or some part of them, are true, and soberly assess the arguments for and against.","num":10.0},{"item":"It is not right to ask whether the vaccines are generally good or not. Some \"experts\" begin to prove that vaccinations against smallpox or yellow fever saved millions of lives. Even if this is so, it is absolutely not important. Parents do not need to make a decision about vaccination against smallpox or from yellow fever. They need to make decisions about other vaccinations.","num":11.0},{"item":"Each vaccination is unique. The safety and effectiveness of each of them is completely different. There are vaccinations which are quite effective, there are those which are almost useless, and there are those whose effectiveness is negative. There are vaccinations which are safer, but there are such that God forbid.\r\nEach vaccination should be dealt with separately. Biologically they work quite differently, and this is important. The measles vaccine is very different from the whooping cough vaccine, and both are very different from the pneumococcal vaccine.\r\n","num":12.0},{"item":"In most developed countries, vaccinations are made against the same diseases, but the number of vaccinations and vaccination schedules in different countries is very different.\r\nIn total there are approximately 15 vaccinations: hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, hemophilia B, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis A, rotavirus, pneumococcus, papilloma and influenza. In some countries, there are vaccinations against tuberculosis and meningococcus.\r\nIt is necessary to make a separate decision for each vaccination. All these diseases are different, some are more dangerous and less dangerous. All vaccinations are also different. There is also a big difference between vaccinations of different manufacturers, their effectiveness and side effects. There is a difference between vaccinations for the same disease in different countries. For example, ethyl mercury, a vaccine preservative that has not been used in Western countries for 25 years, is still used in Russia and in the Third World.","num":13.0},{"item":"In addition to vaccinations, it is necessary to also understand the diseases from which they protect. It is necessary to understand whether childhood illnesses are as dangerous as they are painted. It is necessary to understand how many years the vaccine gives immunity for, and for how many years does it give the transferred illness. It is necessary to understand whether the disease is only harmful, or, perhaps, the transferred illness has also advantages.","num":14.0},{"item":"The decision to do or not to do every inoculation should not be emotional, but purely mathematical. If the likelihood of getting sick and getting complications from it is higher than the probability of a complication from vaccination, it is worth vaccinating. And if it is lower, it's not worth it. This is a simplification, of course, because complications can be more or less severe.","num":15.0},{"item":"In addition to the active substance, they contain many additives. Adjuvants (aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, AAHS, squalene), preservatives and stabilizers (thiomersal, polysorbate 80, gelatin, formaldehyde), fragments of diploid human cells (WI-38, MRC-5), antibiotics, fragments of monkey cells, DNA fragments (human and animals), yeast, urea, borax (cockroach remedy), egg white, sodium glutamate and many others (the complete list [here==https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf]), as well as all kinds of [heavy metals==http://medcraveonline.com/IJVV/IJVV-04-00072.php] not listed on the package. It is necessary to make sure that the concentration of all these ingredients is safe enough to inject them into a healthy newborn baby.","num":16.0},{"item":"It's amazing that even those people who read the inserts in medicines do not read inserts in vaccines, and in general are practically not interested in their side effects, despite the fact that these vaccines they give to their healthy newborn children! Moreover, unlike drugs that are taken orally, and are filtered by the liver and intestines, the entire content of intramuscular vaccinations falls completely into the circulatory, lymphatic or nervous systems.","num":17.0},{"item":"If you read any media, you probably know that in 1998, Andrew Wakefield published a study linking the MMR inoculation with autism. Subsequently, dozens of studies have been published proving that this vaccine does not cause autism, it was proved that Wakefield invented patients, and for this he was deprived of a doctor's license. All anti-vaccination arguments are based on his invented data, and only on this one withdrawn study.\r\nAll this is also a lie and will be discussed in more detail later.","num":18.0},{"item":"There are thousands of studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals that prove both unsafety and the inefficiency of vaccinations.","num":19.0},{"item":"But maybe anti-vaccination arguments are engaged in cherry picking? They base their decision on a thousand studies on the dangers of vaccinations, and ignore a thousand other studies proving the safety of vaccinations?\r\nMaybe. Therefore, it is also necessary to read studies that prove that vaccinations are safe to make sure that they do not usually prove this, and to understand who is actually engaged in cherry picking. It is very important to read these studies completely, and not just the abstracts, because too often the data speak of one thing, and the conclusions speak something quite the opposite. It often happens that a placebo is not a placebo, but a neurotoxin, or another vaccine is used as a placebo. It happens that the data is skewed so that they stop being statistically significant, and from the high Odds Ratio they wave off at p-value = 0.06. It happens that the observation period is only a few days, and conclusions are made about the chronic consequences.\r\nParadoxically, research proving the safety of vaccinations proves their unsafe even more than studies proving their harm.","num":20.0},{"item":"The opportunity to deal with the vaccination problem itself appeared only a few years ago thanks to the Kazakh student Alexandra Elbakyan. Before that, almost all scientific research was inaccessible to the general public, and for reading each article it was necessary to pay $30. Science was hidden from the uninitiated, sealed with seven seals. Now, thanks to the [sci-hub==sci-hub.tw] site, it is possible to find any research for free in just a few seconds, and verify with your own eyes what kind of crap some scientists are involved in.\r\nBless, O Lord, Alexander Elbakyan. He has done more to popularize science than all scientists and journalists combined.","num":21.0},{"item":"To prove that vaccinations are safe and effective, you only need to conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Half the children are vaccinated with all vaccinations, and the second half is not vaccinated at all. There are no such studies, since it is considered unethical at this time not to vaccinate children. Therefore, almost all existing studies are observational studies, case reports, hypotheses, expert opinions, animal studies, etc. There are no studies that check the entire vaccination schedule. Yes, there is an entire calendar, but there is not even adequate research that verifies the safety of any one vaccination!\r\nSo when they say \"vaccinations are safe and effective,\" then this is a priori, an unproved statement. Until such a randomized trial is conducted, the decision to vaccinate or not to vaccinate is, by definition, a choice in uncertain conditions.","num":22.0},{"item":"It is believed that serious side effects from vaccinations occur extremely rarely. One for one hundred thousand, or even one for a million. It's a lie. Since no one has conducted adequate vaccination studies, it is difficult to estimate the real number of side effects, but even with the most optimistic assessments, serious consequences are more frequent than in one in fifty (see part 5). Half (!) of the children in the US [have==https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21570014] at least one chronic disease, and their number is constantly [growing==https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160430100357.htm]. Of course, not all diseases are associated with vaccinations, but who knows how many are related, if no one is researching it?\r\nPersonally, I guess that the consequences of vaccinations are almost everyone. It's just that most of them are implicit, but even if they are obvious, few associate them with vaccination. For example, it is known that brain damage is one of the rare, but possible consequences of vaccination. But in how many children is the brain damage not very significant, and as a result, they will lose only 10 IQ points, or will they have small problems with memory, with concentration, or with social interaction? Could it be that the fall of the [Flynn effect==https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect] (a decrease in the mean IQ) is a consequence of a sharp increase in the number of vaccinations in the last couple of decades? Nobody checked this. But this is a completely logical assumption. If you take a newborn child who has not yet fully formed a blood-brain barrier, and inject him with a vaccine containing mercury or aluminum, which are neurotoxins, and some of which are sure to get into the brain, is it not logical to expect that this or that will affect every child? And if you repeat this procedure several dozen times during the first years of life, is it not logical to assume that this will further strengthen the effect?","num":23.0},{"item":"Reading the scientific research on vaccines at first glance looks very boring. Nevertheless, it was incredibly exciting. At first it feels like being a detective. You try to figure out who is good and who is bad, who is telling the truth, and who is lying. Then it looks like an anti-utopia, when you see how pharmaceutical companies manipulate doctors and scientists, doctors manipulate patients, and patients do not suspect anything, and they demand that the banquet continue.
